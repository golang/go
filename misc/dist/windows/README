dist.bat packages the Go toolchain for Windows in both zip
and installer (msi) format.

Dependencies
============
- Windows Installer XML (WiX) toolset: http://wix.sourceforge.net/
- 7Zip (command line version): http://www.7-zip.org/download.html
- Mercurial (hg): http://mercurial.selenic.com/


Packaging
=========
The dependencies must be callable from dist.bat, therefore,
they'll need to be in/added to the system's search PATH.

The packaging needs to be done from within a tracked Go folder. 
Packages are built by cloning the same version of the source tree
that the Go tools were built from.

To create an i386 distribution package on a 64 bit system, set
GOARCH=386 prior to calling dist.bat.

Run dist.bat from a command prompt or click on the batch file.
