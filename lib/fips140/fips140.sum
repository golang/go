# SHA256 checksums of snapshot zip files in this directory.
# These checksums are included in the FIPS security policy
# (validation instructions sent to the lab) and MUST NOT CHANGE.
# That is, the zip files themselves must not change.
#
# It is okay to add new zip files to the list, and it is okay to
# remove zip files from the list when they are removed from
# this directory. To update this file:
