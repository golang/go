<h2 id="introduction">DRAFT RELEASE NOTES — Introduction to Go 1.21</h2>

<p>
  <strong>
    Go 1.21 is not yet released. These are work-in-progress
    release notes. Go 1.21 is expected to be released in August 2023.
  </strong>
</p>

<p>
  The latest Go release, version 1.21, arrives six months after <a href="/doc/go1.20">Go 1.20</a>.
  Most of its changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and libraries.
  As always, the release maintains the Go 1 <a href="/doc/go1compat">promise of compatibility</a>;
  in fact, Go 1.21 <a href="#godebug">improves upon that promise</a>.
  We expect almost all Go programs to continue to compile and run as before.
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/57631 -->
  Go 1.21 introduces a small change to the numbering of releases.
  In the past, we used Go 1.<i>N</i> to refer to both the overall Go language version and release family
  as well as the first release in that family.
  Starting in Go 1.21, the first release is now Go 1.<i>N</i>.0.
  Today we are releasing both the Go 1.21 language and its initial implementation, the Go 1.21.0 release.
  These notes refer to “Go 1.21”; tools like <code>go</code> <code>version</code> will report “<code>go1.21.0</code>”
  (until you upgrade to Go 1.21.1).
  See “<a href="/doc/toolchain#versions">Go versions</a>” in the “Go Toolchains” documentation for details
  about the new version numbering.
</p>

<h2 id="language">Changes to the language</h2>

<p>
  Go 1.21 adds three new built-ins to the language.

  <ul>
    <li><!-- https://go.dev/issue/59488 -->
      The new functions <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> compute the
      smallest (or largest, for <code>max</code>) value of a fixed number
      of given arguments.
      See the language spec for
      <a href="https://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Min_and_max">details</a>.
    </li>
    <li><!-- https://go.dev/issue/56351 -->
      The new function <code>clear</code> deletes all elements from a
      map or zeroes all elements of a slice.
      See the language spec for
      <a href="https://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Clear">details</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/57411 -->
  Package initialization order is now specified more precisely. The
  new algorithm is:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Sort all packages by import path.
    </li>
    <li>Repeat until the list of packages is empty:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Find the first package in the list for which all imports are
	  already initialized.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Initialize that package and remove it from the list.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  This may change the behavior of some programs that rely on a
  specific initialization ordering that was not expressed by explicit
  imports. The behavior of such programs was not well defined by the
  spec in past releases. The new rule provides an unambiguous definition.
</p>

<p>
  Multiple improvements that increase the power and precision of type inference have been made.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><!-- https://go.dev/issue/59338 -->
    A (possibly partially instantiated generic) function may now be called with arguments that are
    themselves (possibly partially instantiated) generic functions.
    The compiler will attempt to infer the missing type arguments of the callee (as before) and,
    for each argument that is a generic function that is not fully instantiated,
    its missing type arguments (new).
    Typical use cases are calls to generic functions operating on containers
    (such as <a href="/pkg/slices#IndexFunc">slices.IndexFunc</a>) where a function argument
    may also be generic, and where the type argument of the called function and its arguments
    are inferred from the container type.
    More generally, a generic function may now be used without explicit instantiation when
    it is assigned to a variable or returned as a result value if the type arguments can
    be inferred from the assignment.
  </li>
  <li><!-- https://go.dev/issue/60353, https://go.dev/issue/57192, https://go.dev/issue/52397, https://go.dev/issue/41176 -->
    Type inference now also considers methods when a value is assigned to an interface:
    type arguments for type parameters used in method signatures may be inferred from
    the corresponding parameter types of matching methods.
  </li>
  <li><!-- https://go.dev/issue/51593 https://go.dev/issue/39661 -->
    Similarly, since a type argument must implement all the methods of its corresponding constraint,
    the methods of the type argument and constraint are matched which may lead to the inference of
    additional type arguments.
  </li>
  <li><!-- https://go.dev/issue/58671 -->
    If multiple untyped constant arguments of different kinds (such as an untyped int and
    an untyped floating-point constant) are passed to parameters with the same (not otherwise
    specified) type parameter type, instead of an error, now type inference determines the
    type using the same approach as an operator with untyped constant operands.
    This change brings the types inferred from untyped constant arguments in line with the
    types of constant expressions.
  </li>
  <li><!-- https://go.dev/issue/59750 -->
    Type inference is now precise when matching corresponding types in assignments:
    component types (such as the the elements of slices, or the parameter types in function signatures)
    must be identical (given suitable type arguments) to match, otherwise inference fails.
    This change produces more accurate error messages:
    where in the past type inference may have succeeded incorrectly and lead to an invalid assignment,
    the compiler now reports an inference error if two types can't possibly match.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/58650 -->
  More generally, the description of
  <a href="https://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Type_inference">type inference</a>
  in the language spec has been clarified.
  Together, all these changes make type inference more powerful and inference failures less surprising.
</p>

<!-- https://go.dev/issue/57969 -->
<p>
  Go 1.21 includes a preview of a language change we are considering for a future version of Go:
  making for loop variables per-iteration instead of per-loop, to avoid accidental sharing bugs.
  For details about how to try that language change, see <a href="https://go.dev/wiki/LoopvarExperiment">the LoopvarExperiment wiki page</a>.

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>
  Go 1.21 adds improved support for backwards compatibility and forwards compatibility
  in the Go toolchain.
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/56986 -->
  To improve backwards compatibility, Go 1.21 formalizes
  Go's use of the GODEBUG environment variable to control
  the default behavior for changes that are non-breaking according to the
  <a href="/doc/go1compat">compatibility policy</a>
  but nonetheless may cause existing programs to break.
  (For example, programs that depend on buggy behavior may break
  when a bug is fixed, but bug fixes are not considered breaking changes.)
  When Go must make this kind of behavior change,
  it now chooses between the old and new behavior based on the
  <code>go</code> line in the workspace's <code>go.work</code> file
  or else the main module's <code>go.mod</code> file.
  Upgrading to a new Go toolchain but leaving the <code>go</code> line
  set to its original (older) Go version preserves the behavior of the older
  toolchain.
  With this compatibility support, the latest Go toolchain should always
  be the best, most secure, implementation of an older version of Go.
  See “<a href="/doc/godebug">Go, Backwards Compatibility, and GODEBUG</a>” for details.
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/57001 -->
  To improve forwards compatibility, Go 1.21 now reads the <code>go</code> line
  in a <code>go.work</code> or <code>go.mod</code> file as a strict
  minimum requirement: <code>go</code> <code>1.21.0</code> means
  that the workspace or module cannot be used with Go 1.20 or with Go 1.21rc1.
  This allows projects that depend on fixes made in later versions of Go
  to ensure that they are not used with earlier versions.
  It also gives better error reporting for projects that make use of new Go features:
  when the problem is that a newer Go version is needed,
  that problem is reported clearly, instead of attempting to build the code
  and instead printing errors about unresolved imports or syntax errors.
</p>

<p>
  To make these new stricter version requirements easier to manage,
  the <code>go</code> command can now invoke not just the toolchain
  bundled in its own release but also other Go toolchain versions found in the PATH
  or downloaded on demand.
  If a <code>go.mod</code> or <code>go.work</code> <code>go</code> line
  declares a minimum requirement on a newer version of Go, the <code>go</code>
  command will find and run that version automatically.
  The new <code>toolchain</code> directive sets a suggested minimum toolchain to use,
  which may be newer than the strict <code>go</code> minimum.
  See “<a href="/doc/toolchain">Go Toolchains</a>” for details.
</p>

<h3 id="go-command">Go command</h3>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/58099, CL 474236 -->
  The <code>-pgo</code> build flag now defaults to <code>-pgo=auto</code>,
  and the restriction of specifying a single main package on the command
  line is now removed. If a file named <code>default.pgo</code> is present
  in the main package's directory, the <code>go</code> command will use
  it to enable profile-guided optimization for building the corresponding
  program.
</p>

<p>
  The <code>-C</code> <code>dir</code> flag must now be the first
  flag on the command-line when used.
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/37708, CL 463837 -->
  The new <code>go</code> <code>test</code> option
  <code>-fullpath</code> prints full path names in test log messages,
  rather than just base names.
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/15513, CL 466397 -->
  The <code>go</code> <code>test</code> <code>-c</code> flag now
  supports writing test binaries for multiple packages, each to
  <code>pkg.test</code> where <code>pkg</code> is the package name.
  It is an error if more than one test package being compiled has a given package name.]
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/15513, CL 466397 -->
  The <code>go</code> <code>test</code> <code>-o</code> flag now
  accepts a directory argument, in which case test binaries are written to that
  directory instead of the current directory.
</p>

<h3 id="cgo">Cgo</h3>

<p><!-- CL 490819 -->
  In files that <code>import "C"</code>, the Go toolchain now
  correctly reports errors for attempts to declare Go methods on C types.
</p>

<h2 id="runtime-changes">Runtime</h2>

<p>
  TODO: complete this section, or delete if not needed
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/7181 -->
  When printing very deep stacks, the runtime now prints the first 50
  (innermost) frames followed by the bottom 50 (outermost) frames,
  rather than just printing the first 100 frames. This makes it easier
  to see how deeply recursive stacks started, and is especially
  valuable for debugging stack overflows.
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/59960 -->
  On Linux platforms that support transparent huge pages, the Go runtime
  now manages which parts of the heap may be backed by huge pages more
  explicitly. This leads to better utilization of memory: small heaps
  should see less memory used (up to 50% in pathological cases) while
  large heaps should see fewer broken huge pages for dense parts of the
  heap, improving CPU usage and latency by up to 1%.
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/57069, https://go.dev/issue/56966 -->
  As a result of runtime-internal garbage collection tuning,
  applications may see up to a 40% reduction in application tail latency
  and a small decrease in memory use. Some applications may also observe
  a small loss in throughput.

  The memory use decrease should be proportional to the loss in
  throughput, such that the previous release's throughput/memory
  tradeoff may be recovered (with little change to latency) by
  increasing <code>GOGC</code> and/or <code>GOMEMLIMIT</code> slightly.
</p>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/51676 -->
  Calls from C to Go on threads created in C require some setup to prepare for
  Go execution. On Unix platforms, this setup is now preserved across multiple
  calls from the same thread. This significantly reduces the overhead of
  subsequent C to Go calls from ~1-3 microseconds per call to ~100-200
  nanoseconds per call.
</p>

<h2 id="compiler">Compiler</h2>

<p>
  Profile-guide optimization (PGO), added as a preview in Go 1.20, is now ready
  for general use. PGO enables additional optimizations on code identified as
  hot by profiles of production workloads. As mentioned in the
  <a href="#go-command">Go command section</a>, PGO is enabled by default for
  binaries that contain a <code>default.pgo</code> profile in the main
  package directory. Performance improvements vary depending on application
  behavior, with most programs from a representative set of Go programs seeing
  between 2 and 7% improvement from enabling PGO. See the
  <a href="/doc/pgo">PGO user guide</a> for detailed documentation.
</p>

<!-- https://go.dev/issue/59959 -->
<p>
  PGO builds can now devirtualize some interface method calls, adding a
  concrete call to the most common callee. This enables further optimization,
  such as inlining the callee.

<h2 id="assembler">Assembler</h2>

<!-- https://go.dev/issue/58378 -->
<p>
  On amd64, frameless nosplit assembly functions are no longer automatically marked as <code>NOFRAME</code>.
  Instead, the <code>NOFRAME</code> attribute must be explicitly specified if desired,
  which is already the behavior on other architectures supporting frame pointers.
  With this, the runtime now maintains the frame pointers for stack transitions.
</p>

<!-- CL 476295 -->
<p>
  The verifier that checks for incorrect uses of <code>R15</code> when dynamic linking on amd64 has been improved.
</p>

<h2 id="linker">Linker</h2>

<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/57302, CL 461749 -->
  On Windows AMD64, the linker (with help from the compiler) now emits
  SEH unwinding data by default, which improves the integration
  of Go applications with Windows debuggers and other tools.
</p>

<!-- CL 457455 -->
<p>
  <!-- cmd/link: generate .xdata PE section -->
</p>
<!-- CL 463395, CL 461315 -->
<p>
  In Go 1.21 the linker (with help from the compiler) is now capable of
  deleting dead (unreferenced) global map variables, if the number of
  entries in the variable initializer is sufficiently large, and if the
  initializer expressions are side-effect free.

        CL 477295, CL 484096, CL 486376, CL 486415, CL 487855 -->
  The new <a href="/pkg/log/slog">log/slog</a> package provides structured logging with levels.
  Structured logging emits key-value pairs
  to enable fast, accurate processing of large amounts of log data.
  The package supports integration with popular log analysis tools and services.
</p>

  The new <a href="/pkg/slices">slices</a> package provides many common
  operations on slices, using generic functions that work with slices
  of any element type.
</p>

<h3 id="maps">New maps package</h3>

      <code>GODEBUG=cgocheck=2</code>, a thorough checker of cgo pointer passing rules,
      is no longer available as a <a href="/pkg/runtime#hdr-Environment_Variables">debug option</a>.
      Instead, it is available as an experiment using <code>GOEXPERIMENT=cgocheck2</code>.
      In particular this means that this mode has to be selected at build time instead of startup time.

      <code>GODEBUG=cgocheck=1</code> is still available (and is still the default).

      A new type <code>Pinner</code> has been added to the runtime
      package. <code>Pinner</code>s may be used to "pin" Go memory
      such that it may be used more freely by non-Go code. For instance,
      passing Go values that reference pinned Go memory to C code is
      now allowed. Previously, passing any such nested reference was
      disallowed by the
      <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo#hdr-Passing_pointers">cgo pointer passing rules.</a>

      See <a href="/pkg/runtime#Pinner">the docs</a> for more details.
