}-->

<div class="left-column">
<p>
The Go Playground is a web service that runs on 
<a href="http://golang.org/">golang.org</a>'s servers.
The service receives a Go program, compiles, links, and runs the program inside 
a sandbox, then returns the output.
</p>

<p>
There are limitations to the programs that can be run in the Playground.
They must be single-threaded (but they may use many goroutines).
There are also limits on execution time, and CPU and memory usage.
The Playground can access only a subset of the standard library
(notably absent are network and file system access).
Therefore, the only communication a Playground program has to the outside world
is via standard output.
