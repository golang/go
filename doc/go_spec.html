Open issues:
[ ] Semantics of type declaration:
	- creating a new type (status quo), or only a new type name?
	- declaration "type T S" strips methods of S. why/why not?
	- no mechanism to declare a local type name: type T P.T


Todo
[ ] clarify: two equal lowercase identifiers from different packages denote different objects
[ ] need language about function/method calls and parameter passing rules
[ ] need to say something about "scope" of selectors?
[ ] clarify what a field name is in struct declarations
    (struct{T} vs struct {T T} vs struct {t T})
[ ] need explicit language about the result type of operations
[ ] may want to have some examples for the types of shift operations
[ ] document illegality of package-external tuple assignments to structs
	w/ private fields: P.T(1, 2) illegal since same as P.T(a: 1, b: 2) for
	a T struct { a b int }.
[ ] should probably write something about evaluation order of statements even
	though obvious
[ ] specify iteration direction for range clause
[ ] review language on implicit dereferencing

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
This is a reference manual for the Go programming language. For
more information and other documents, see <a href="http://go/go">go/go</a>.
</p>

<p>
Go is a general-purpose language designed with systems programming
in mind. It is strongly typed and garbage-collected and has explicit
support for concurrent programming.  Programs are constructed from
<i>packages</i>, whose properties allow efficient management of
dependencies. The existing implementations use a traditional
compile/link model to generate executable binaries.
</p>

<p>
The grammar is compact and regular, allowing for easy analysis by
automatic tools such as integrated development environments.
</p>

<h2 id="Notation">Notation</h2>
<p>
The syntax is specified using Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF):
</p>

<pre class="grammar">
Production  = production_name "=" Expression "." .
Expression  = Alternative { "|" Alternative } .
Alternative = Term { Term } .
Term        = production_name | token [ "..." token ] | Group | Option | Repetition .
Group       = "(" Expression ")" .
Option      = "[" Expression "]" .
Repetition  = "{" Expression "}" .
</pre>

<p>
Productions are expressions constructed from terms and the following
operators, in increasing precedence:
</p>
<pre class="grammar">
|   alternation
()  grouping
[]  option (0 or 1 times)
{}  repetition (0 to n times)
</pre>

<p>
Lower-case production names are used to identify lexical tokens.
Non-terminals are in CamelCase. Lexical symbols are enclosed in
double quotes <code>""</code> or back quotes <code>``</code>.
</p>

<p>
The form <code>a ... b</code> represents the set of characters from
<code>a</code> through <code>b</code> as alternatives.
</p>

<h2 id="Source_code_representation">Source code representation</h2>

<p>
Source code is Unicode text encoded in UTF-8. The text is not
canonicalized, so a single accented code point is distinct from the
same character constructed from combining an accent and a letter;
those are treated as two code points.  For simplicity, this document
will use the term <i>character</i> to refer to a Unicode code point.
</p>
<p>
Each code point is distinct; for instance, upper and lower case letters
are different characters.
</p>

<h3 id="Characters">Characters</h3>

<p>
The following terms are used to denote specific Unicode character classes:
</p>
<pre class="ebnf">
unicode_char   = /* an arbitrary Unicode code point */ .
unicode_letter = /* a Unicode code point classified as "Letter" */ .
unicode_digit  = /* a Unicode code point classified as "Digit" */ .
</pre>

<p>
In <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.1.0/">The Unicode Standard 5.1</a>,
Section 4.5 General Category-Normative
defines a set of character categories.  Go treats
those characters in category Lu, Ll, Lt, Lm, or Lo as Unicode letters,
and those in category Nd as Unicode digits.
</p>

<h3 id="Letters_and_digits">Letters and digits</h3>

<p>
The underscore character <code>_</code> (U+005F) is considered a letter.
</p>
<pre class="ebnf">
letter        = unicode_letter | "_" .
decimal_digit = "0" ... "9" .
octal_digit   = "0" ... "7" .
hex_digit     = "0" ... "9" | "A" ... "F" | "a" ... "f" .
</pre>

<h2 id="Lexical_elements">Lexical elements</h2>

<h3 id="Comments">Comments</h3>

<p>
There are two forms of comments.  The first starts at the character
sequence <code>//</code> and continues through the next newline.  The
second starts at the character sequence <code>/*</code> and continues
through the character sequence <code>*/</code>.  Comments do not nest.
</p>

<h3 id="Tokens">Tokens</h3>

<p>
Tokens form the vocabulary of the Go language.
There are four classes: identifiers, keywords, operators
and delimiters, and literals.  <i>White space</i>, formed from
blanks, tabs, and newlines, is ignored except as it separates tokens
that would otherwise combine into a single token.  Comments
behave as white space.  While breaking the input into tokens,
the next token is the longest sequence of characters that form a
valid token.
</p>

<h3 id="Identifiers">Identifiers</h3>

<p>
Identifiers name program entities such as variables and types.
An identifier is a sequence of one or more letters and digits.
The first character in an identifier must be a letter.
</p>
<pre class="ebnf">
identifier = letter { letter | unicode_digit } .
</pre>
<pre>
a
_x9
ThisVariableIsExported
αβ
</pre>
Some identifiers are <a href="#Predeclared_identifiers">predeclared</a>.

<h3 id="Keywords">Keywords</h3>

<p>
The following keywords are reserved and may not be used as identifiers.
</p>
<pre class="grammar">
break        default      func         interface    select
case         defer        go           map          struct

     &amp;^          &amp;^=
</pre>

<h3 id="Integer_literals">Integer literals</h3>

<p>
An integer literal is a sequence of digits representing an
<a href="#Constants">integer constant</a>.
An optional prefix sets a non-decimal base: <code>0</code> for octal, <code>0x</code> or
<code>0X</code> for hexadecimal.  In hexadecimal literals, letters
<code>a-f</code> and <code>A-F</code> represent values 10 through 15.
</p>
<pre class="ebnf">
int_lit     = decimal_lit | octal_lit | hex_lit .
decimal_lit = ( "1" ... "9" ) { decimal_digit } .
octal_lit   = "0" { octal_digit } .
hex_lit     = "0" ( "x" | "X" ) hex_digit { hex_digit } .

<h3 id="Floating-point_literals">Floating-point literals</h3>
<p>
A floating-point literal is a decimal representation of a
<a href="#Constants">floating-point constant</a>.
It has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part,
and an exponent part.  The integer and fractional part comprise
decimal digits; the exponent part is an <code>e</code> or <code>E</code>
followed by an optionally signed decimal exponent.  One of the
integer part or the fractional part may be elided; one of the decimal
point or the exponent may be elided.
</p>
<pre class="ebnf">
float_lit = decimals "." [ decimals ] [ exponent ] |
            decimals exponent |
            "." decimals [ exponent ] .

<h3 id="Character_literals">Character literals</h3>

<p>
A character literal represents an <a href="#Constants">integer constant</a>,
typically a Unicode code point, as one or more characters enclosed in single
quotes.  Within the quotes, any character may appear except single
quote and newline. A single quoted character represents itself,
while multi-character sequences beginning with a backslash encode
values in various formats.
</p>
<p>
The simplest form represents the single character within the quotes;
since Go source text is Unicode characters encoded in UTF-8, multiple
UTF-8-encoded bytes may represent a single integer value.  For
instance, the literal <code>'a'</code> holds a single byte representing
a literal <code>a</code>, Unicode U+0061, value <code>0x61</code>, while
<code>'ä'</code> holds two bytes (<code>0xc3</code> <code>0xa4</code>) representing
a literal <code>a</code>-dieresis, U+00E4, value <code>0xe4</code>.
</p>
<p>
Several backslash escapes allow arbitrary values to be represented
as ASCII text.  There are four ways to represent the integer value
as a numeric constant: <code>\x</code> followed by exactly two hexadecimal
digits; <code>\u</code> followed by exactly four hexadecimal digits;
<code>\U</code> followed by exactly eight hexadecimal digits, and a
plain backslash <code>\</code> followed by exactly three octal digits.
In each case the value of the literal is the value represented by
the digits in the corresponding base.
</p>
<p>
Although these representations all result in an integer, they have
different valid ranges.  Octal escapes must represent a value between
0 and 255 inclusive.  Hexadecimal escapes satisfy this condition
by construction. The escapes <code>\u</code> and <code>\U</code>
represent Unicode code points so within them some values are illegal,
in particular those above <code>0x10FFFF</code> and surrogate halves.
</p>
<p>
After a backslash, certain single-character escapes represent special values:
</p>
<pre class="grammar">
\a   U+0007 alert or bell
\b   U+0008 backspace
\f   U+000C form feed
\n   U+000A line feed or newline
\r   U+000D carriage return
\t   U+0009 horizontal tab
\v   U+000b vertical tab
\\   U+005c backslash
\'   U+0027 single quote  (valid escape only within character literals)
\"   U+0022 double quote  (valid escape only within string literals)
</pre>
<p>
All other sequences are illegal inside character literals.
</p>
<pre class="ebnf">
char_lit         = "'" ( unicode_value | byte_value ) "'" .
unicode_value    = unicode_char | little_u_value | big_u_value | escaped_char .
byte_value       = octal_byte_value | hex_byte_value .
octal_byte_value = `\` octal_digit octal_digit octal_digit .
hex_byte_value   = `\` "x" hex_digit hex_digit .
little_u_value   = `\` "u" hex_digit hex_digit hex_digit hex_digit .
big_u_value      = `\` "U" hex_digit hex_digit hex_digit hex_digit
                           hex_digit hex_digit hex_digit hex_digit .
escaped_char     = `\` ( "a" | "b" | "f" | "n" | "r" | "t" | "v" | `\` | "'" | `"` ) .

</pre>


<h3 id="String_literals">String literals</h3>

<p>
A string literal represents a <a href="#Constants">string constant</a>
obtained from concatenating a sequence of characters. There are two forms:
raw string literals and interpreted string literals.
</p>
<p>
Raw string literals are character sequences between back quotes
<code>``</code>.  Within the quotes, any character is legal except
back quote. The value of a raw string literal is the
string composed of the uninterpreted characters between the quotes;
in particular, backslashes have no special meaning and the string may
span multiple lines.
</p>
<p>
Interpreted string literals are character sequences between double
quotes <code>&quot;&quot;</code>. The text between the quotes forms the
value of the literal, with backslash escapes interpreted as they
are in character literals (except that <code>\'</code> is illegal and
<code>\"</code> is legal).  The three-digit octal (<code>\000</code>)
and two-digit hexadecimal (<code>\x00</code>) escapes represent individual
<i>bytes</i> of the resulting string; all other escapes represent
the (possibly multi-byte) UTF-8 encoding of individual <i>characters</i>.
Thus inside a string literal <code>\377</code> and <code>\xFF</code> represent
a single byte of value <code>0xFF</code>=255, while <code>ÿ</code>,
<code>\u00FF</code>, <code>\U000000FF</code> and <code>\xc3\xbf</code> represent
the two bytes <code>0xc3</code> <code>0xbf</code> of the UTF-8 encoding of character
U+00FF.
</p>

<p>
A sequence of string literals is concatenated to form a single string.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
StringLit              = string_lit { string_lit } .
string_lit             = raw_string_lit | interpreted_string_lit .
raw_string_lit         = "`" { unicode_char } "`" .
interpreted_string_lit = """ { unicode_value | byte_value } """ .
</pre>

<pre>
`abc`  // same as "abc"
`\n
\n`    // same as "\\n\n\\n"
"\n"
""
"Hello, world!\n"
"日本語"
"\u65e5本\U00008a9e"
"\xff\u00FF"
"Alea iacta est."
"Alea " /* The die */ `iacta est` /* is cast */ "."  // same as "Alea iacta est."
</pre>

<p>
These examples all represent the same string:
</p>

<pre>
"日本語"                                 // UTF-8 input text
`日本語`                                 // UTF-8 input text as a raw literal
"\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"                    // The explicit Unicode code points
"\U000065e5\U0000672c\U00008a9e"        // The explicit Unicode code points
"\xe6\x97\xa5\xe6\x9c\xac\xe8\xaa\x9e"  // The explicit UTF-8 bytes
</pre>

<p>
If the source code represents a character as two code points, such as
a combining form involving an accent and a letter, the result will be
an error if placed in a character literal (it is not a single code
point), and will appear as two code points if placed in a string
literal.
</p>


<h2 id="Constants">Constants</h2>

<p>There are <i>boolean constants</i>, <i>integer constants</i>, <i>floating-point constants</i>,
and <i>string constants</i>. Integer and floating-point constants are
collectively called <i>numeric constants</i>.
</p>

<p>
A constant value is represented by an
<a href="#Integer_literals">integer</a>,
<a href="#Floating-point_literals">floating-point</a>,
<a href="#Character_literals">character</a>, or
<a href="#String_literals">string</a> literal,
an identifier denoting a constant,
a <a href="#Constant_expressions">constant expression</a>, or
the result value of some built-in functions such as <code>unsafe.Sizeof</code>
and <code>cap</code> or <code>len</code> applied to an array,
or <code>len</code> applied to a string constant.
The boolean truth values are represented by the predeclared constants
<code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. The predeclared identifier
<a href="#Iota">iota</a> denotes an integer constant.
</p>

<p>
Numeric constants represent values of arbitrary precision that
have no size and cannot overflow.
</p>

<p>
Constants may be <a href="#Types">typed</a> or untyped.
Literal constants, <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>iota</code>,
and certain <a href="#Constant_expressions">constant expressions</a>
containing only untyped constant operands are untyped.
</p>

<p>
A constant may be given a type explicitly by a <a href="#Constant_declarations">constant declaration</a>
or <a href="#Conversions">conversion</a>, or implicitly when used in a
<a href="#Variable_declarations">variable declaration</a> or an
<a href="#Assignments">assignment</a> or as an
operand in an <a href="#Expressions">expression</a>.
It is an error if the constant value
cannot be accurately represented as a value of the respective type.
For instance, <code>3.0</code> can be given any integer type but also any
floating-point type, while <code>-1e12</code> can be given the types
<code>float32</code>, <code>float64</code>, or even <code>int64</code> but
not <code>uint64</code> or <code>string</code>.
</p>

<p>
Implementation restriction: A compiler may implement numeric constants by choosing
an internal representation with at least twice as many bits as any machine type;
for floating-point values, both the mantissa and exponent must be twice as large.
</p>


<h2 id="Types">Types</h2>

<p>
A type determines the set of values and operations specific to values of that
type.  A type may be specified by a (possibly qualified) <i>type name</i>
(§<a href="#Qualified_identifier">Qualified identifier</a>, §<a href="#Type_declarations">Type declarations</a>) or a <i>type literal</i>,
which composes a new type from previously declared types.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
Type      = TypeName | TypeLit | "(" Type ")" .
TypeName  = QualifiedIdent.
TypeLit   = ArrayType | StructType | PointerType | FunctionType | InterfaceType |
	    SliceType | MapType | ChannelType .
</pre>

<p>
Named instances of the boolean, numeric, and string types are <a href="#Predeclared_identifiers">predeclared</a>.
Array, struct, pointer, function, interface, slice, map, and channel types may be constructed using type literals.
</p>

<p>
A type may have a <i>method set</i> associated with it
(§<a href="#Interface_types">Interface types</a>, §<a href="#Method_declarations">Method declarations</a>).
The method set of an <a href="#Interface_types">interface type</a> is its interface.
The method set of any other named type <code>T</code>
consists of all methods with receiver
type <code>T</code>.
The method set of the corresponding pointer type <code>*T</code>
is the set of all methods with receiver <code>*T</code> or <code>T</code>
(that is, it also contains the method set of <code>T</code>).
Any other type has an empty method set.
</p>
<p>
The <i>static type</i> (or just <i>type</i>) of a variable is the
type defined by its declaration.  Variables of interface type
also have a distinct <i>dynamic type</i>, which
is the actual type of the value stored in the variable at run-time.
The dynamic type may vary during execution but is always assignment compatible
to the static type of the interface variable.  For non-interface
types, the dynamic type is always the static type.
</p>


<h3 id="Boolean_types">Boolean types</h3>

A <i>boolean type</i> represents the set of Boolean truth values
denoted by the predeclared constants <code>true</code>
and <code>false</code>. The predeclared boolean type is <code>bool</code>.


<h3 id="Numeric_types">Numeric types</h3>

<p>
A <i>numeric type</i> represents sets of integer or floating-point values.
The predeclared architecture-independent numeric types are:
</p>

<pre class="grammar">
uint8    the set of all unsigned  8-bit integers (0 to 255)
uint16   the set of all unsigned 16-bit integers (0 to 65535)
uint32   the set of all unsigned 32-bit integers (0 to 4294967295)
uint64   the set of all unsigned 64-bit integers (0 to 18446744073709551615)

int8     the set of all signed  8-bit integers (-128 to 127)
int16    the set of all signed 16-bit integers (-32768 to 32767)
int32    the set of all signed 32-bit integers (-2147483648 to 2147483647)
int64    the set of all signed 64-bit integers (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)

float32  the set of all IEEE-754 32-bit floating-point numbers
float64  the set of all IEEE-754 64-bit floating-point numbers

byte     familiar alias for uint8
</pre>

<p>
Integer types are represented in the usual binary format; the value of
an n-bit integer is n bits wide. A negative signed integer is represented
as the two's complement of its absolute value.
</p>

<p>
There is also a set of predeclared numeric types with implementation-specific sizes:
</p>

<pre class="grammar">
uint     either 32 or 64 bits
int      either 32 or 64 bits
float    either 32 or 64 bits
uintptr  an unsigned integer large enough to store the uninterpreted bits of a pointer value
</pre>

<p>
To avoid portability issues all numeric types are distinct except
<code>byte</code>, which is an alias for <code>uint8</code>.
Conversions
are required when incompatible numeric types are mixed in an expression
or assignment. For instance, <code>int32</code> and <code>int</code>
are not the same type even though they may have the same size on a
particular architecture.


<h3 id="String_types">String types</h3>

<p>
A <i>string type</i> represents the set of string values.
Strings behave like arrays of bytes but are immutable: once created,
it is impossible to change the contents of a string.
The predeclared string type is <code>string</code>.

<p>
The elements of strings have type <code>byte</code> and may be
accessed using the usual indexing operations (§<a href="#Indexes">Indexes</a>).  It is
illegal to take the address of such an element; if
<code>s[i]</code> is the <i>i</i>th byte of a
string, <code>&amp;s[i]</code> is invalid.  The length of string
<code>s</code> can be discovered using the built-in function
<code>len</code>. The length is a compile-time constant if <code>s</code>
is a string literal.
</p>


<h3 id="Array_types">Array types</h3>

<p>
An array is a numbered sequence of elements of a single
type, called the element type.
The number of elements is called the length and is never
negative.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
ArrayType   = "[" ArrayLength "]" ElementType .
ArrayLength = Expression .
ElementType = Type .
</pre>

<p>
The length is part of the array's type and must must be a
<a href="#Constant_expressions">constant expression</a> that evaluates to a non-negative
integer value.  The length of array <code>a</code> can be discovered
using the built-in function <code>len(a)</code>, which is a
compile-time constant.  The elements can be indexed by integer
indices 0 through the <code>len(a)-1</code> (§<a href="#Indexes">Indexes</a>).
</p>

<pre>
[32]byte
[2*N] struct { x, y int32 }
[1000]*float64
</pre>

<h3 id="Slice_types">Slice types</h3>

<p>
A slice is a reference to a contiguous segment of an array and
contains a numbered sequence of elements from that array.  A slice
type denotes the set of all slices of arrays of its element type.
A slice value may be <code>nil</code>.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
SliceType = "[" "]" ElementType .
</pre>

<p>
Like arrays, slices are indexable and have a length.  The length of a
slice <code>s</code> can be discovered by the built-in function
<code>len(s)</code>; unlike with arrays it may change during
execution.  The elements can be addressed by integer indices 0
through <code>len(s)-1</code> (§<a href="#Indexes">Indexes</a>).  The slice index of a
given element may be less than the index of the same element in the
underlying array.
</p>
<p>
A slice, once initialized, is always associated with an underlying
array that holds its elements.  A slice therfore shares storage
with its array and with other slices of the same array; by contrast,
distinct arrays always represent distinct storage.
</p>
<p>
The array underlying a slice may extend past the end of the slice.
The <i>capacity</i> is a measure of that extent: it is the sum of
the length of the slice and the length of the array beyond the slice;
a slice of length up to that capacity can be created by `slicing' a new
one from the original slice (§<a href="#Slices">Slices</a>).
The capacity of a slice <code>a</code> can be discovered using the
built-in function <code>cap(a)</code> and the relationship between
<code>len()</code> and <code>cap()</code> is:
</p>

<pre>
0 <= len(a) <= cap(a)
</pre>

<p>
The value of an uninitialized slice is <code>nil</code>.
The length and capacity of a <code>nil</code> slice
are 0. A new, initialized slice value for a given element type <code>T</code> is
made using the built-in function <code>make</code>, which takes a slice type
and parameters specifying the length and optionally the capacity:
</p>

<pre>
make([]T, length)
make([]T, length, capacity)
</pre>

<p>
The <code>make()</code> call allocates a new, hidden array to which the returned
slice value refers. That is, executing
</p>

<pre>
make([]T, length, capacity)
</pre>

<p>
produces the same slice as allocating an array and slicing it, so these two examples
result in the same slice:
</p>

<pre>
make([]int, 50, 100)
new([100]int)[0:50]
</pre>


<h3 id="Struct_types">Struct types</h3>

<p>
A struct is a sequence of named
elements, called fields, with various types. A struct type declares
an identifier and type for each field. Within a struct, non-<a href="#Blank_identifier">blank</a>
field identifiers must be unique.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
StructType = "struct" "{" [ FieldDeclList ] "}" .
FieldDeclList = FieldDecl { ";" FieldDecl } [ ";" ] .
FieldDecl = (IdentifierList Type | [ "*" ] TypeName) [ Tag ] .
Tag = StringLit .
</pre>

<pre>
// An empty struct.
struct {}

// A struct with 6 fields.
struct {
	x, y int;
	u float;
	_ float;  // padding
	A *[]int;
	F func();
}
</pre>

<p>
A field declared with a type but no field identifier is an <i>anonymous field</i>.
Such a field type must be specified as
a type name <code>T</code> or as a pointer to a type name <code>*T</code>,
and <code>T</code> itself may not be
a pointer type. The unqualified type name acts as the field identifier.
</p>

<pre>
// A struct with four anonymous fields of type T1, *T2, P.T3 and *P.T4
struct {
	T1;        // the field name is T1
	*T2;       // the field name is T2
	P.T3;      // the field name is T3
	*P.T4;     // the field name is T4
	x, y int;
}
</pre>

<p>
The unqualified type name of an anonymous field must be distinct from the
field identifier (or unqualified type name for an anonymous field) of every
other field within the struct. The following declaration is illegal:
</p>

<pre>
struct {
	T;         // conflicts with anonymous field *T and *P.T
	*T;        // conflicts with anonymous field T and *P.T
	*P.T;      // conflicts with anonymous field T and *T
}
</pre>

<p>
Fields and methods (§<a href="#Method_declarations">Method declarations</a>) of an anonymous field are
promoted to be ordinary fields and methods of the struct (§<a href="#Selectors">Selectors</a>).
The following rules apply for a struct type named <code>S</code> and
a type named <code>T</code>:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>If <code>S</code> contains an anonymous field <code>T</code>, the
	    method set of <code>S</code> includes the method set of <code>T</code>.
	</li>

	<li>If <code>S</code> contains an anonymous field <code>*T</code>, the
	    method set of <code>S</code> includes the method set of <code>*T</code>
	    (which itself includes the method set of <code>T</code>).
	</li>

	<li>If <code>S</code> contains an anonymous field <code>T</code> or
	    <code>*T</code>, the method set of <code>*S</code> includes the
	    method set of <code>*T</code> (which itself includes the method
	    set of <code>T</code>).
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
A field declaration may be followed by an optional string literal <i>tag</i>,
which becomes an attribute for all the identifiers in the corresponding
field declaration. The tags are made
visible through a <a href="#Package_unsafe">reflection interface</a>
but are otherwise ignored.
</p>

<pre>
// A struct corresponding to the TimeStamp protocol buffer.
// The tag strings define the protocol buffer field numbers.
struct {
	microsec  uint64 "field 1";
	serverIP6 uint64 "field 2";
	process   string "field 3";
}
</pre>

<h3 id="Pointer_types">Pointer types</h3>

<p>
A pointer type denotes the set of all pointers to variables of a given
type, called the <i>base type</i> of the pointer.
A pointer value may be <code>nil</code>.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
PointerType = "*" BaseType .
BaseType = Type .
</pre>

<pre>
*int
*map[string] *chan int
</pre>

<h3 id="Function_types">Function types</h3>

<p>
A function type denotes the set of all functions with the same parameter
and result types.
A function value may be <code>nil</code>.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
FunctionType   = "func" Signature .
Signature      = Parameters [ Result ] .
Result         = Parameters | Type .
Parameters     = "(" [ ParameterList ] ")" .
ParameterList  = ParameterDecl { "," ParameterDecl } .
ParameterDecl  = [ IdentifierList ] ( Type | "..." ) .
</pre>

<p>
Within a list of parameters or results, the names (IdentifierList)
must either all be present or all be absent. If present, each name
stands for one item (parameter or result) of the specified type; if absent, each
type stands for one item of that type.  Parameter and result
lists are always parenthesized except that if there is exactly
one unnamed result that is not a function type it may writen as an unparenthesized type.
</p>
<p>
For the last parameter only, instead of a type one may write
<code>...</code> to indicate that the function may be invoked with
zero or more additional arguments of any
type.
</p>

<pre>
func ()
func (x int)
func () int
func (string, float, ...)
func (a, b int, z float) bool
func (a, b int, z float) (bool)
func (a, b int, z float, opt ...) (success bool)
func (int, int, float) (float, *[]int)
func (n int) (func (p* T))
</pre>


<h3 id="Interface_types">Interface types</h3>

<p>
An interface type specifies a method set called its <i>interface</i>.
A variable of interface type can store a value of any type with a method set
that is any superset of the interface. Such a type is said to
<i>implement the interface</i>. An interface value may be <code>nil</code>.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
InterfaceType      = "interface" "{" [ MethodSpecList ] "}" .
MethodSpecList     = MethodSpec { ";" MethodSpec } [ ";" ] .
MethodSpec         = IdentifierList Signature | InterfaceTypeName .
InterfaceTypeName  = TypeName .
</pre>

<pre>
// A simple File interface
interface {
	Read, Write	(b Buffer) bool;
	Close		();
}
</pre>

<p>
More than one type may implement an interface.
For instance, if two types <code>S1</code> and <code>S2</code>
have the method set
</p>

<pre>
func (p T) Read(b Buffer) bool { return ... }
func (p T) Write(b Buffer) bool { return ... }
func (p T) Close() { ... }
</pre>

<p>
(where <code>T</code> stands for either <code>S1</code> or <code>S2</code>)
then the <code>File</code> interface is implemented by both <code>S1</code> and
<code>S2</code>, regardless of what other methods
<code>S1</code> and <code>S2</code> may have or share.
</p>

<p>
A type implements any interface comprising any subset of its methods
and may therefore implement several distinct interfaces. For
instance, all types implement the <i>empty interface</i>:
</p>

<pre>
interface{}
</pre>

<p>
Similarly, consider this interface specification,
which appears within a <a href="#Type_declarations">type declaration</a>
to define an interface called <code>Lock</code>:
</p>

<pre>
type Lock interface {
	Lock, Unlock	();
}
</pre>

<p>
If <code>S1</code> and <code>S2</code> also implement
</p>

<pre>
func (p T) Lock() { ... }
func (p T) Unlock() { ... }
</pre>

<p>
they implement the <code>Lock</code> interface as well
as the <code>File</code> interface.
</p>
<p>
An interface may contain an interface type name <code>T</code>
in place of a method specification.
In this notation, <code>T</code> must denote a different interface type
and the effect is equivalent to enumerating the methods of <code>T</code> explicitly
in the interface.
</p>

<pre>
type ReadWrite interface {
	Read, Write	(b Buffer) bool;
}

type File interface {
	ReadWrite;  // same as enumerating the methods in ReadWrite
	Lock;       // same as enumerating the methods in Lock
	Close();
}
</pre>

<h3 id="Map_types">Map types</h3>

<p>
A map is an unordered group of elements of one type, called the
value type, indexed by a set of unique <i>keys</i> of another type,
called the key type.
A map value may be <code>nil</code>.

</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
MapType     = "map" "[" KeyType "]" ElementType .
KeyType     = Type .
ValueType   = Type .
</pre>

<p>
The comparison operators <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>
(§<a href="#Comparison_operators">Comparison operators</a>) must be fully defined for operands of the
key type; thus the key type must be a boolean, numeric, string, pointer, function, interface,
map, or channel type. If the key type is an interface type, these
comparison operators must be defined for the dynamic key values;
failure will cause a run-time error.

</p>

<pre>
map [string] int
map [*T] struct { x, y float }
map [string] interface {}
</pre>

<p>
The number of elements is called the length and is never negative.
The length of a map <code>m</code> can be discovered using the
built-in function <code>len(m)</code> and may change during execution.
Values may be added and removed
during execution using special forms of <a href="#Assignments">assignment</a>.
</p>
<p>
The value of an uninitialized map is <code>nil</code>.
A new, empty map value is made using the built-in
function <code>make</code>, which takes the map type and an optional
capacity hint as arguments:
</p>

<pre>
make(map[string] int)
make(map[string] int, 100)
</pre>

<p>
The initial capacity does not bound its size:
maps grow to accommodate the number of items
stored in them.
</p>

<h3 id="Channel_types">Channel types</h3>

<p>
A channel provides a mechanism for two concurrently executing functions
to synchronize execution and communicate by passing a value of a
specified element type.
A value of channel type may be <code>nil</code>.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
ChannelType   = Channel | SendChannel | RecvChannel .
Channel       = "chan" ValueType .
SendChannel   = "chan" "&lt;-" ValueType .
RecvChannel   = "&lt;-" "chan" ValueType .
</pre>

<p>
Upon creation, a channel can be used both to send and to receive values.
By conversion or assignment, a channel may be constrained only to send or
to receive. This constraint is called a channel's <i>direction</i>; either
<i>send</i>, <i>receive</i>, or <i>bi-directional</i> (unconstrained).
</p>

<pre>
chan T            // can be used to send and receive values of type T
chan&lt;- float   // can only be used to send floats
&lt;-chan int     // can only be used to receive ints
</pre>

<p>
The value of an uninitialized channel is <code>nil</code>. A new, initialized channel
value is made using the built-in function <code>make</code>,
which takes the channel type and an optional capacity as arguments:
</p>


<pre>
make(chan int, 100)
</pre>

<p>
The capacity, in number of elements, sets the size of the buffer in the channel. If the
capacity is greater than zero, the channel is asynchronous: provided the
buffer is not full, sends can succeed without blocking. If the capacity is zero
or absent, the communication succeeds only when both a sender and receiver are ready.
</p>

<p>
For a channel <code>c</code>, the predefined function <code>close(c)</code>
marks the channel as unable to accept more
values through a send operation.  After any previously
sent values have been received, receives will return
the zero value for the channel's type.  After at least one such zero value has been
received, <code>closed(c)</code> returns true.
</p>

<h2 id="Properties_of_types_and_values">Properties of types and values</h2>

<p>
Two types may be <i>identical</i>, <i>compatible</i>, or <i>incompatible</i>.
Two identical types are always compatible, but two compatible types may not be identical.
</p>

<h3 id="Type_identity_and_compatibility">Type identity and compatibility</h3>

<h4 id="Type_identity">Type identity</h4>

<p>
Two named types are identical if their type names originate in the same
type declaration (§<a href="#Declarations_and_scope">Declarations and scope</a>). A named and an unnamed type
are never identical. Two unnamed types are identical if the corresponding
type literals have the same literal structure and corresponding components have
identical types. In detail:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Two array types are identical if they have identical element types and
	    the same array length.</li>

	<li>Two slice types are identical if they have identical element types.</li>

	<li>Two struct types are identical if they have the same sequence of fields,
	    and if corresponding fields have the same names and identical types.
	    Two anonymous fields are considered to have the same name.</li>

	<li>Two pointer types are identical if they have identical base types.</li>

	<li>Two function types are identical if they have the same number of parameters
	    and result values and if corresponding parameter and result types are
	    identical. All "..." parameters are defined to have identical type.
	    Parameter and result names are not required to match.</li>

	<li>Two interface types are identical if they have the same set of methods
	    with the same names and identical function types. The order
	    of the methods is irrelevant.</li>

	<li>Two map types are identical if they have identical key and value types.</li>

	<li>Two channel types are identical if they have identical value types and
	    the same direction.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Type_compatibility">Type compatibility</h4>

<p>
Type compatibility is less stringent than type identity: a named and an unnamed
type are compatible if the respective type literals are compatible.
In all other respects, the definition of type compatibility is the
same as for type identity listed above but with ``compatible''
substituted for ``identical''.
</p>

<p>
Given the declarations
</p>

<pre>
type (
	T0 []string;
	T1 []string;
	T2 struct { a, b int };
	T3 struct { a, c int };
	T4 func (int, float) *T0;
	T5 func (x int, y float) *[]string;
)
</pre>

<p>
these types are identical:
</p>

<pre>
T0 and T0
[]int and []int
struct { a, b *T5 } and struct { a, b *T5 }
func (x int, y float) *[]string and func (int, float) (result *[]string)
</pre>

<p>
<code>T0</code> and <code>T1</code> are neither identical nor compatible
because they are named types with distinct declarations.
</p>

<p>
These types are compatible:
</p>

<pre>
T0 and T0
T0 and []string
T3 and struct { a int; c int }
T4 and func (x int, y float) *[]string
</pre>

<p>
<code>T2</code> and <code>struct { a, c int }</code> are incompatible because
they have different field names.
</p>

<h3 id="Assignment_compatibility">Assignment compatibility</h3>

<p>
A value <code>v</code> of static type <code>V</code> is <i>assignment compatible</i>
with a type <code>T</code> if one of the following conditions applies:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>V</code> is compatible with <code>T</code>.
</li>
<li>
<code>T</code> is an interface type and
<code>V</code> <a href="#Interface_types">implements</a> <code>T</code>.
</li>
<li>
<code>V</code> is a pointer to an array and <code>T</code> is a slice type
with compatible element type and at least one of <code>V</code> or <code>T</code> is unnamed.
After assignment, the slice variable refers to the original array; the elements are not
copied.
</li>
<li>
<code>V</code> is a bidirectional channel and <code>T</code> is a channel type
with compatible element type and at least one of <code>V</code> or <code>T</code> is unnamed.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
An untyped <a href="#Constants">constant</a> <code>v</code>
is assignment compatible with type <code>T</code> if <code>v</code>
can be represented accurately as a value of type <code>T</code>.
</p>

<p>
The predeclared identifier <code>nil</code> is assignment compatible with any
pointer, function, slice, map, channel, or interface type and
represents the <a href="#The_zero_value">zero value<a> for that type.
</p>

<p>
Any value may be assigned to the <a href="#Blank_identifier">blank identifier</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="Comparison_compatibility">Comparison compatibility</h3>

<p>
Except as noted, values of any type may be compared to other values of
<a href="#Type_compatibility">compatible static type</a>.
Values of numeric and string type may be compared using the
full range of <a href="#Comparison_operators;">comparison operators</a>;
booleans may be compared only for equality or inequality.
</p>

<p>
Values of composite type may be
compared for equality or inequality using the <code>==</code> and
<code>!=</code> operators, with the following provisos:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Arrays and structs may not be compared to anything.
</li>
<li>
A slice value may only be compared explicitly against <code>nil</code>.
A slice value is equal to <code>nil</code> if it has been assigned the explicit
value <code>nil</code>, if it is uninitialized, or if it has
been assigned another slice value equal to <code>nil</code>·
</li>
<li>
Similarly, an interface value is equal to <code>nil</code> if it has
been assigned the explicit value <code>nil</code>, if it is uninitialized,
or if it has been assigned another interface value equal to <code>nil</code>.
</li>
<li>
For types that can be compared to <code>nil</code>,
two values of the same type are equal if they both equal <code>nil</code>,
unequal if one equals <code>nil</code> and one does not.
</li>
<li>
Pointer values are equal if they point to the same location.
</li>
<li>
Function values are equal if they refer to the same function.
</li>
<li>
Channel and map values are equal if they were created by the same call to <code>make</code>
(§<a href="#Making_slices">Making slices</a>, maps, and channels).
When comparing two values of channel type, the channel value types
must be compatible but the channel direction is ignored.
</li>
<li>
Interface values may be compared if they have compatible static types.
They will be equal only if they have the same dynamic type and the underlying values are equal.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Blocks">Blocks</h2>

<p>
A <i>block</i> is a sequence of declarations and statements within matching
brace brackets.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
Block = "{" StatementList "}" .
</pre>

<p>
In addition to explicit blocks in the source code, there are implicit blocks:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>The <i>universe block</i> encompasses all Go source text.</li>

	<li>Each <a href="#Packages">package</a> has a <i>package block</i> containing all
	    Go source text for that package.</li>

	<li>Each file has a <i>file block</i> containing all Go source text
	    in that file.</li>

	<li>Each <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, and <code>switch</code>
	    statement is considered to be in its own implicit block.</li>

	<li>Each clause in a <code>switch</code> or <code>select</code> statement
	    acts as an implicit block.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Blocks nest and influence <a href="#Declarations_and_scope">scoping</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="Declarations_and_scope">Declarations and scope</h2>

<p>
A declaration binds a non-<a href="#Blank_identifier">blank</a>
identifier to a constant, type, variable, function, or package.
Every identifier in a program must be declared.
No identifier may be declared twice in the same block, and
no identifier may be declared in both the file and package block.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
Declaration   = ConstDecl | TypeDecl | VarDecl .
TopLevelDecl  = Declaration | FunctionDecl | MethodDecl .
</pre>

<p>
The <i>scope</i> of a declared identifier is the extent of source text in which
the identifier denotes the specified constant, type, variable, function, or package.
</p>

<p>
Go is lexically scoped using blocks:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>The scope of a predeclared identifier is the universe block.</li>

	<li>The scope of an identifier denoting a constant, type, variable,
	    or function declared at top level (outside any function) is the
	    package block.</li>

	<li>The scope of an imported package identifier is the file block
	    of the file containing the import declaration.</li>

	<li>The scope of an identifier denoting a function parameter or
	    result variable is the function body.</li>

	<li>The scope of a constant or variable identifier declared
	    inside a function begins at the end of the ConstSpec or VarSpec
	    and ends at the end of the innermost containing block.</li>

	<li>The scope of a type identifier declared inside a function
	    begins at the identifier in the TypeSpec
	    and ends at the end of the innermost containing block.</li>
</ol>

<p>
An identifier declared in a block may be redeclared in an inner block.
While the identifier of the inner declaration is in scope, it denotes
the entity declared by the inner declaration.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="#Package_clause">package clause</a> is not a declaration; the package name
does not appear in any scope. Its purpose is to identify the files belonging
to the same <a href="#Packages">package</a> and to specify the default name for import
declarations.
</p>


<h3 id="Label_scopes">Label scopes</h3>

<p>
Labels are declared by <a href="#Labeled_statements">labeled statements</a> and are
used in the <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>, and <code>goto</code>
statements (§<a href="#Break_statements">Break statements</a>, §<a href="#Continue_statements">Continue statements</a>, §<a href="#Goto_statements">Goto statements</a>).
In contrast to other identifiers, labels are not block scoped and do
not conflict with identifiers that are not labels. The scope of a label
is the body of the function in which it is declared and excludes
the body of any nested function.
</p>


<h3 id="Predeclared_identifiers">Predeclared identifiers</h3>

<p>
The following identifiers are implicitly declared in the universe block:
</p>
<pre class="grammar">
Basic types:
	bool byte float32 float64 int8 int16 int32 int64
	string uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64

Architecture-specific convenience types:
	float int uint uintptr

Constants:
	true false iota

Zero value:
	nil

Functions:
	cap close closed len make new panic panicln print println
</pre>


<h3 id="Exported_identifiers">Exported identifiers</h3>

<p>
An identifier may be <i>exported</i> to permit access to it from another package
using a <a href="#Qualified_identifiers">qualified identifier</a>. An identifier
is exported if both:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>the first character of the identifier's name is a Unicode upper case letter (Unicode class "Lu"); and
	<li>the identifier is declared in the <a href="#Blocks">package block</a> or denotes a field or method of a type
	    declared in that block.
</ol>
<p>
All other identifiers are not exported.
</p>


<h3 id="Blank_identifier">Blank identifier</h3>

<p>
The <i>blank identifier</i>, represented by the underscore character <code>_</code>, may be used in a declaration like
any other identifier but the declaration does not introduce a new binding.
</p>


<h3 id="Constant_declarations">Constant declarations</h3>

<p>
A constant declaration binds a list of identifiers (the names of
the constants) to the values of a list of <a href="#Constant_expressions">constant expressions</a>.
The number of identifiers must be equal
to the number of expressions, and the <i>n</i>th identifier on
the left is bound to the value of the <i>n</i>th expression on the
right.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
ConstDecl      = "const" ( ConstSpec | "(" [ ConstSpecList ] ")" ) .
ConstSpecList  = ConstSpec { ";" ConstSpec } [ ";" ] .
ConstSpec      = IdentifierList [ [ Type ] "=" ExpressionList ] .

IdentifierList = identifier { "," identifier } .
ExpressionList = Expression { "," Expression } .
</pre>

<p>
If the type is present, all constants take the type specified, and
the expressions must be <a href="#Assignment_compatibility">assignment compatible</a> with that type.
If the type is omitted, the constants take the
individual types of the corresponding expressions.
If the expression values are untyped <a href="#Constants">constants</a>,
the declared constants remain untyped and the constant identifiers
denote the constant values. For instance, if the expression is a
floating-point literal, the constant identifier denotes a floating-point
constant, even if the literal's fractional part is zero.
</p>

<pre>
const Pi float64 = 3.14159265358979323846
const zero = 0.0             // untyped floating-point constant
const (
	size int64 = 1024;
	eof = -1;            // untyped integer constant
)
const a, b, c = 3, 4, "foo"  // a = 3, b = 4, c = "foo", untyped integer and string constants
const u, v float = 0, 3      // u = 0.0, v = 3.0
</pre>

<p>
Within a parenthesized <code>const</code> declaration list the
expression list may be omitted from any but the first declaration.
Such an empty list is equivalent to the textual substitution of the
first preceding non-empty expression list and its type if any.
Omitting the list of expressions is therefore equivalent to
repeating the previous list.  The number of identifiers must be equal
to the number of expressions in the previous list.
Together with the <a href="#Iota"><code>iota</code> constant generator</a>
this mechanism permits light-weight declaration of sequential values:
</p>

<h3 id="Iota">Iota</h3>

<p>
Within a constant declaration, the predeclared pseudo-constant
<code>iota</code> represents successive untyped integer <a href="#Constants">
constants</a>. It is reset to 0 whenever the reserved word <code>const</code>
appears in the source and increments with each semicolon. It can be used to construct a
set of related constants:
</p>

<pre>
const (  // iota is reset to 0
	c0 = iota;  // c0 == 0
	c1 = iota;  // c1 == 1
	c2 = iota   // c2 == 2
)

const (
	a = 1 &lt;&lt; iota;  // a == 1 (iota has been reset)
	b = 1 &lt;&lt; iota;  // b == 2
	c = 1 &lt;&lt; iota;  // c == 4
)

const (
	u       = iota * 42;  // u == 0     (untyped integer constant)
	v float = iota * 42;  // v == 42.0  (float constant)
	w       = iota * 42;  // w == 84    (untyped integer constant)
)

const x = iota;  // x == 0 (iota has been reset)
const y = iota;  // y == 0 (iota has been reset)
</pre>

<p>
Within an ExpressionList, the value of each <code>iota</code> is the same because
it is only incremented at a semicolon:
</p>

<pre>
const (
	bit0, mask0 = 1 &lt;&lt; iota, 1 &lt;&lt; iota - 1;  // bit0 == 1, mask0 == 0
	bit1, mask1;                             // bit1 == 2, mask1 == 1
	_, _;                                    // skips iota == 2
	bit3, mask3;                             // bit3 == 8, mask3 == 7
)
</pre>

<p>
This last example exploits the implicit repetition of the
last non-empty expression list.

<h3 id="Type_declarations">Type declarations</h3>

<p>
A type declaration binds an identifier, the <i>type name</i>,
to a new type.  <font color=red>TODO: what exactly is a "new type"?</font>
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
TypeDecl     = "type" ( TypeSpec | "(" [ TypeSpecList ] ")" ) .

<h3 id="Variable_declarations">Variable declarations</h3>

<p>
A variable declaration creates a variable, binds an identifier to it and
gives it a type and optionally an initial value.
</p>
<pre class="ebnf">
VarDecl     = "var" ( VarSpec | "(" [ VarSpecList ] ")" ) .
VarSpecList = VarSpec { ";" VarSpec } [ ";" ] .
VarSpec     = IdentifierList ( Type [ "=" ExpressionList ] | "=" ExpressionList ) .
</pre>

<pre>
var i int
var U, V, W float
var k = 0

var (
	i int;
	u, v, s = 2.0, 3.0, "bar"
)
var re, im = complexSqrt(-1)
var _, found = entries[name];  // map lookup; only interested in "found"
</pre>

<p>
If a list of expressions is given, the variables are initialized
by assigning the expressions to the variables (§<a href="#Assignments">Assignments</a>)
in order; all expressions must be consumed and all variables initialized from them.
Otherwise, each variable is initialized to its <a href="#The_zero_value"><i>zero value</i></a>.
</p>

<p>
If the type is present, each variable is given that type.
Otherwise, the types are deduced from the assignment
of the expression list.
</p>

<p>
If the type is absent and the corresponding expression evaluates to an
untyped <a href="#Constants">constant</a>, the type of the declared variable
is <code>bool</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, or <code>string</code>
respectively, depending on whether the value is a boolean, integer,
floating-point, or string constant:
</p>

<pre>
var b = true    // t has type bool
var i = 0       // i has type int
var f = 3.0     // f has type float
var s = "OMDB"  // s has type string
</pre>

<h3 id="Short_variable_declarations">Short variable declarations</h3>

A <i>short variable declaration</i> uses the syntax:

<pre class="ebnf">
ShortVarDecl = IdentifierList ":=" ExpressionList .
</pre>

It is a shorthand for a regular variable declaration with
initializer expressions but no types:

<pre class="grammar">
"var" IdentifierList = ExpressionList .
</pre>

<pre>
i, j := 0, 10;
f := func() int { return 7; }
ch := make(chan int);
r, w := os.Pipe(fd);  // os.Pipe() returns two values
_, y, _ := coord(p);  // coord() returns three values; only interested in y coordinate
</pre>

<p>
Unlike regular variable declarations, a short variable declaration may redeclare variables provided they
were originally declared in the same block with the same type, and at
least one of the non-<a href="#Blank_identifier">blank</a> variables is new.  As a consequence, redeclaration
can only appear in a multi-variable short declaration.
Redeclaration does not introduce a new
variable; it just assigns a new value to the original.
</p>

<pre>
field1, offset := nextField(str, 0);
field2, offset := nextField(str, offset);  // redeclares offset
</pre>

<p>
Short variable declarations may appear only inside functions.
In some contexts such as the initializers for <code>if</code>,
<code>for</code>, or <code>switch</code> statements,
they can be used to declare local temporary variables (§<a href="#Statements">Statements</a>).
</p>

<h3 id="Function_declarations">Function declarations</h3>

<p>
A function declaration binds an identifier to a function (§<a href="#Function_types">Function types</a>).
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
FunctionDecl = "func" identifier Signature [ Body ] .
Body         = Block.
</pre>

<p>
A function declaration may omit the body. Such a declaration provides the
signature for a function implemented outside Go, such as an assembly routine.
</p>

<pre>
func min(x int, y int) int {
	if x &lt; y {
		return x;
	}
	return y;
}

func flushICache(begin, end uintptr)  // implemented externally
</pre>

<h3 id="Method_declarations">Method declarations</h3>

<p>
A method declaration binds an identifier to a method,
which is a function with a <i>receiver</i>.
</p>
<pre class="ebnf">
MethodDecl = "func" Receiver MethodName Signature [ Body ] .
Receiver = "(" [ identifier ] [ "*" ] TypeName ")" .
MethodName = identifier .
</pre>

<p>
The receiver type must be of the form <code>T</code> or <code>*T</code> where
<code>T</code> is a type name. <code>T</code> is called the
<i>receiver base type</i> or just <i>base type</i>.
The base type must not be a pointer or interface type and must be
declared in the same package as the method.
The method is said to be <i>bound</i> to the base type
and is visible only within selectors for that type
(§<a href="#Type_declarations">Type declarations</a>, §<a href="#Selectors">Selectors</a>).
</p>

<p>
Given type <code>Point</code>, the declarations
</p>

<pre>
func (p *Point) Length() float {
	return Math.sqrt(p.x * p.x + p.y * p.y);
}

func (p *Point) Scale(factor float) {
	p.x = p.x * factor;
	p.y = p.y * factor;
}
</pre>

<p>
bind the methods <code>Length</code> and <code>Scale</code>,
with receiver type <code>*Point</code>,
to the base type <code>Point</code>.
</p>

<p>
If the receiver's value is not referenced inside the the body of the method,
its identifier may be omitted in the declaration. The same applies in
general to parameters of functions and methods.
</p>

<p>
The type of a method is the type of a function with the receiver as first
argument.  For instance, the method <code>Scale</code> has type
</p>

<pre>
(p *Point, factor float)
</pre>

<p>
However, a function declared this way is not a method.
</p>


<h2 id="Expressions">Expressions</h2>

<p>
An expression specifies the computation of a value by applying
operators and functions to operands.

A qualified identifier is a non-<a href="#Blank_identifier">blank</a> identifier qualified by a package name prefix.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
QualifiedIdent = [ PackageName "." ] identifier .

<p>
A qualified identifier accesses an identifier in a separate package.

<font color=red>TODO: Unify this section with Selectors - it's the same syntax.</font>
</p>

<h3 id="Composite_literals">Composite literals</h3>

<p>
Composite literals construct values for structs, arrays, slices, and maps
and create a new value each time they are evaluated.
They consist of the type of the value
followed by a brace-bound list of composite elements. An element may be
a single expression or a key-value pair.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
CompositeLit  = LiteralType "{" [ ElementList ] "}" .
LiteralType   = StructType | ArrayType | "[" "..." "]" ElementType |
                SliceType | MapType | TypeName .
ElementList   = Element { "," Element } [ "," ] .
Element       = [ Key ":" ] Value .
Key           = FieldName | Index .
FieldName     = identifier .
Value         = Expression .
</pre>

<p>
The LiteralType must be a struct, array, slice, or map type
(the grammar enforces this constraint except when the type is given
as a TypeName).
The types of the expressions must be <a href="#Assignment_compatibility">assignment compatible</a> to
the respective field, element, and key types of the LiteralType;
there is no additional conversion.
The key is interpreted as a field name for struct literals,
an index expression for array and slice literals, and a key for map literals.
For map literals, all elements must have a key. It is an error
to specify multiple elements with the same field name or
constant key value.
</p>

<p>
For struct literals the following rules apply:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A literal that does not contain any keys must
	    list an element for each struct field in the
	    order in which the fields are declared.
	</li>
	<li>If any element has a key, every element must have a key.
	</li>
	<li>A literal that contains keys does not need to
	    have an element for each struct field. Omitted fields
	    get the zero value for that field.
	</li>
	<li>A literal may omit the element list; such a literal evaluates
		to the zero value for its type.
	</li>
	<li>It is an error to specify an element for a non-exported
	    field of a struct belonging to a different package.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
Given the declarations
</p>
<pre>
type Point struct { x, y, z float }
type Line struct { p, q Point }
</pre>

<p>
one may write
</p>

<pre>
origin := Point{};                            // zero value for Point
line := Line{origin, Point{y: -4, z: 12.3}};  // zero value for line.q.x
</pre>

<p>
For array and slice literals the following rules apply:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Each element has an associated integer index marking
	    its position in the array.
	</li>
	<li>An element with a key uses the key as its index; the
	    key must be a constant integer expression.
	</li>
	<li>An element without a key uses the previous element's index plus one.
	    If the first element has no key, its index is zero.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
Taking the address of a composite literal (§<a href="#Address_operators">Address operators</a>)
generates a unique pointer to an instance of the literal's value.
</p>
<pre>
var pointer *Point = &amp;Point{y: 1000};
</pre>

<p>
The length of an array literal is the length specified in the LiteralType.
If fewer elements than the length are provided in the literal, the missing
elements are set to the zero value for the array element type.
It is an error to provide elements with index values outside the index range
of the array. The notation <code>...</code> specifies an array length equal
to the maximum element index plus one.
</p>

<pre>
buffer := [10]string{};               // len(buffer) == 10
intSet := [6]int{1, 2, 3, 5};         // len(intSet) == 6
days := [...]string{"Sat", "Sun"};    // len(days) == 2
</pre>

<p>
A slice literal describes the entire underlying array literal.
Thus, the length and capacity of a slice literal are the maximum
element index plus one. A slice literal has the form
</p>

<pre>
[]T{x1, x2, ... xn}
</pre>

<p>
and is a shortcut for a slice operation applied to an array literal:
</p>

<pre>
[n]T{x1, x2, ... xn}[0 : n]
</pre>

<p>
A parsing ambiguity arises when a composite literal using the
TypeName form of the LiteralType appears in the condition of an
"if", "for", or "switch" statement, because the braces surrounding
the expressions in the literal are confused with those introducing
a block of statements. To resolve the ambiguity in this rare case,
the composite literal must appear within
parentheses.
</p>

<pre>
if x == (T{a,b,c}[i]) { ... }
if (x == T{a,b,c}[i]) { ... }
</pre>

<p>
Examples of valid array, slice, and map literals:
</p>

<pre>
// list of prime numbers
primes := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 991};

// vowels[ch] is true if ch is a vowel
vowels := [128]bool{'a': true, 'e': true, 'i': true, 'o': true, 'u': true, 'y': true};

// the array [10]float{-1, 0, 0, 0, -0.1, -0.1, 0, 0, 0, -1};

// frequencies in Hz for equal-tempered scale (A4 = 440Hz)

}

<h3 id="Function_literals">Function literals</h3>

<p>
A function literal represents an anonymous function.
It consists of a specification of the function type and a function body.
</p>

<pre>
func (a, b int, z float) bool { return a*b &lt; int(z) }

<pre>
f := func(x, y int) int { return x + y }

Function literals are <i>closures</i>: they may refer to variables
defined in a surrounding function. Those variables are then shared between
the surrounding function and the function literal, and they survive as long
as they are accessible.

<h3 id="Selectors">Selectors</h3>

<p>
A primary expression of the form
</p>

<pre>
x.f
</pre>

<p>
denotes the field or method <code>f</code> of the value denoted by <code>x</code>
(or of <code>*x</code> if
<code>x</code> is of pointer type). The identifier <code>f</code>
is called the (field or method)
<i>selector</i>; it must not be the <a href="#Blank_identifier">blank identifier</a>.
The type of the expression is the type of <code>f</code>.
</p>
<p>
A selector <code>f</code> may denote a field or method <code>f</code> of
a type <code>T</code>, or it may refer
to a field or method <code>f</code> of a nested anonymous field of
<code>T</code>.
The number of anonymous fields traversed
to reach <code>f</code> is called its <i>depth</i> in <code>T</code>.
The depth of a field or method <code>f</code>
declared in <code>T</code> is zero.
The depth of a field or method <code>f</code> declared in
an anonymous field <code>A</code> in <code>T</code> is the
depth of <code>f</code> in <code>A</code> plus one.
</p>
<p>
The following rules apply to selectors:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
For a value <code>x</code> of type <code>T</code> or <code>*T</code>
where <code>T</code> is not an interface type,
<code>x.f</code> denotes the field or method at the shallowest depth
in <code>T</code> where there
is such an <code>f</code>.
If there is not exactly one <code>f</code> with shallowest depth, the selector
expression is illegal.
</li>
<li>
For a variable <code>x</code> of type <code>I</code> or <code>*I</code>
where <code>I</code> is an interface type,
<code>x.f</code> denotes the actual method with name <code>f</code> of the value assigned
to <code>x</code> if there is such a method.
If no value or <code>nil</code> was assigned to <code>x</code>, <code>x.f</code> is illegal.
</li>
<li>
In all other cases, <code>x.f</code> is illegal.
</ol>
<p>
Selectors automatically dereference pointers.
If <code>x</code> is of pointer type, <code>x.y</code>
is shorthand for <code>(*x).y</code>; if <code>y</code>
is also of pointer type, <code>x.y.z</code> is shorthand
for <code>(*(*x).y).z</code>, and so on.
If <code>*x</code> is of pointer type, dereferencing
must be explicit;
only one level of automatic dereferencing is provided.
For an <code>x</code> of type <code>T</code> containing an
anonymous field declared as <code>*A</code>,
<code>x.f</code> is a shortcut for <code>(*x.A).f</code>.
</p>
<p>
For example, given the declarations:
</p>

<h3 id="Indexes">Indexes</h3>

<p>
A primary expression of the form
</p>

<pre>
a[x]
</pre>

<p>
denotes the element of the array, slice, string or map <code>a</code> indexed by <code>x</code>.
The value <code>x</code> is called the
<i>index</i> or <i>map key</i>, respectively. The following
rules apply:
</p>

<p>
For <code>a</code> of type <code>A</code> or <code>*A</code>
where <code>A</code> is an <a href="#Array_types">array type</a>,
or for <code>a</code> of type <code>S</code> where <code>S</code> is a <a href="#Slice_types">slice type</a>:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>x</code> must be an integer value and <code>0 &lt;= x &lt; len(a)</code>
	<li><code>a[x]</code> is the array element at index <code>x</code> and the type of
	  <code>a[x]</code> is the element type of <code>A</code>
</ul>

<p>
For <code>a</code> of type <code>T</code>
where <code>T</code> is a <a href="#String_types">string type</a>:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>x</code> must be an integer value and <code>0 &lt;= x &lt; len(a)</code>
	<li><code>a[x]</code> is the byte at index <code>x</code> and the type of
	  <code>a[x]</code> is <code>byte</code>
	<li><code>a[x]</code> may not be assigned to
</ul>

<p>
For <code>a</code> of type <code>M</code>
where <code>M</code> is a <a href="#Map_types">map type</a>:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>x</code>'s type must be compatible with the key type of <code>M</code>
	  and the map must contain an entry with key <code>x</code> (but see special forms below)
	<li><code>a[x]</code> is the map value with key <code>x</code>
	  and the type of <code>a[x]</code> is the value type of <code>M</code>
</ul>

<p>
Otherwise <code>a[x]</code> is illegal.  If the index or key is out of range evaluating
an otherwise legal index expression, a run-time exception occurs.
</p>

<p>
However, if an index expression on a map <code>a</code> of type <code>map[K] V</code>
is used in an assignment or initialization of the form
</p>

<pre>
r, ok = a[x]
r, ok := a[x]
var r, ok = a[x]
</pre>

<p>
the result of the index expression is a pair of values with types
<code>(K, bool)</code>.
If the key is present in the map,
the expression returns the pair <code>(a[x], true)</code>;
otherwise it returns <code>(Z, false)</code> where <code>Z</code> is
the <a href="#The_zero_value">zero value</a> for <code>V</code>.
No run-time exception occurs in this case.
The index expression in this construct thus acts like a function call
returning a value and a boolean indicating success.  (§<a href="#Assignments">Assignments</a>)
</p>

<p>
Similarly, if an assignment to a map has the special form
</p>

<pre>
a[x] = r, ok
</pre>

<p>
and boolean <code>ok</code> has the value <code>false</code>,
the entry for key <code>x</code> is deleted from the map; if
<code>ok</code> is <code>true</code>, the construct acts like
a regular assignment to an element of the map.
</p>

<h3 id="Slices">Slices</h3>

<p>
Strings, arrays, and slices can be <i>sliced</i> to construct substrings or descriptors
of subarrays. The index expressions in the slice select which elements appear
in the result.  The result has indexes starting at 0 and length equal to the
difference in the index values in the slice.  After slicing the array <code>a</code>
</p>

<pre>
a := [4]int{1, 2, 3, 4};
s := a[1:3];
</pre>

<p>
the slice <code>s</code> has type <code>[]int</code>, length 2, capacity 3, and elements
</p>

<pre>
s[0] == 2
s[1] == 3
</pre>

<p>
The slice length must not be negative.
For arrays or strings, the indexes
<code>lo</code> and <code>hi</code> must satisfy
0 &lt;= <code>lo</code> &lt;= <code>hi</code> &lt;= length;
for slices, the upper bound is the capacity rather than the length.
</p>

<p>
If the sliced operand is a string or slice, the result of the slice operation
is a string or slice of the same type.
If the sliced operand is an array, the result of the slice operation is a slice
with the same element type as the array.
</p>


<h3 id="Type_assertions">Type assertions</h3>

<p>
For an expression <code>x</code> and a type <code>T</code>, the primary expression
</p>

<pre>
x.(T)
</pre>

<p>
asserts that <code>x</code> is not the zero interface value
and that the value stored in <code>x</code> is of type <code>T</code>.
The notation <code>x.(T)</code> is called a <i>type assertion</i>.
The type of <code>x</code> must be an interface type.
</p>
<p>
More precisely, if <code>T</code> is not an interface type, <code>x.(T)</code> asserts
that the dynamic type of <code>x</code> is identical to the type <code>T</code>
(§<a href="#Type_identity_and_compatibility">Type identity and compatibility</a>).
If <code>T</code> is an interface type, <code>x.(T)</code> asserts that the dynamic type
of <code>T</code> implements the interface <code>T</code> (§<a href="#Interface_types">Interface types</a>).
</p>
<p>
If the type assertion holds, the value of the expression is the value
stored in <code>x</code> and its type is <code>T</code>. If the type assertion is false, a run-time
exception occurs. In other words, even though the dynamic type of <code>x</code>
is known only at run-time, the type of <code>x.(T)</code> is
known to be <code>T</code> in a correct program.

If a type assertion is used in an assignment or initialization of the form
</p>

<pre>
v, ok = x.(T)
v, ok := x.(T)
var v, ok = x.(T)
</pre>

<p>
the result of the assertion is a pair of values with types <code>(T, bool)</code>.
If the assertion holds, the expression returns the pair <code>(x.(T), true)</code>;
otherwise, the expression returns <code>(Z, false)</code> where <code>Z</code>
is the <a href="#The_zero_value">zero value</a> for type <code>T</code>.
No run-time exception occurs in this case.
The type assertion in this construct thus acts like a function call

<h3 id="Calls">Calls</h3>

<p>
Given an expression <code>f</code> of function type
<code>F</code>,
</p>

<pre>
f(a1, a2, ... an)
</pre>

<p>
calls <code>f</code> with arguments <code>a1, a2, ... an</code>.
The arguments must be single-valued expressions
<a href="#Assignment_compatibility">assignment compatible</a> with the parameters of
<code>F</code> and are evaluated before the function is called.
The type of the expression is the result type
of <code>F</code>.
A method invocation is similar but the method itself
is specified as a selector upon a value of the receiver type for
the method.
</p>

<pre>
Atan2(x, y)    // function call
var pt *Point;
pt.Scale(3.5)  // method call with receiver pt
</pre>

<p>
A method call <code>x.m()</code> is valid if the method set of
(the type of) <code>x</code> contains <code>m</code> and the
argument list is compatible with the parameter list of <code>m</code>.
If <code>x</code> is <a href="#Address_operators">addressable</a> and <code>&amp;x</code>'s method
set contains <code>m</code>, <code>x.m()</code> is shorthand
for <code>(&amp;x).m()</code>:
</p>

<pre>
var p Point;
p.Scale(3.5)
</pre>

<p>
There is no distinct method type and there are no method literals.
</p>

<h3 id="Passing_arguments_to_..._parameters">Passing arguments to <code>...</code> parameters</h3>

<p>
When a function <code>f</code> has a <code>...</code> parameter,
it is always the last formal parameter. Within calls to <code>f</code>,
the arguments before the <code>...</code> are treated normally.
After those, an arbitrary number (including zero) of trailing
arguments may appear in the call and are bound to the <code>...</code>
parameter.
</p>

<p>
Within <code>f</code>, the <code>...</code> parameter has static
type <code>interface{}</code> (the empty interface). For each call,
its dynamic type is a structure whose sequential fields are the
trailing arguments of the call.  That is, the actual arguments
provided for a <code>...</code> parameter are wrapped into a struct
that is passed to the function instead of the actual arguments.
Using the <a href="#Package_unsafe">reflection</a> interface, <code>f</code> may
unpack the elements of the dynamic type to recover the actual
arguments.
</p>

<p>
Given the function and call
</p>
<pre>
func Fprintf(f io.Writer, format string, args ...)
Fprintf(os.Stdout, "%s %d", "hello", 23);
</pre>

<p>
Within <code>Fprintf</code>, the dynamic type of <code>args</code> for this
call will be, schematically,
<code> struct { string; int }</code>.
</p>


<p>
As a special case, if a function passes its own <code>...</code> parameter as the argument
for a <code>...</code> in a call to another function with a <code>...</code> parameter,
the parameter is not wrapped again but passed directly. In short, a formal <code>...</code>
parameter is passed unchanged as an actual <code>...</code> parameter.

<h3 id="Operators">Operators</h3>

<p>
Operators combine operands into expressions.
</p>

</pre>

<p>
Comparisons are discussed <a href="#Comparison_operators">elsewhere</a>.
For other binary operators, the operand types must be identical
(§<a href="#Properties_of_types_and_values">Properties of types and values</a>)
unless the operation involves channels, shifts, or untyped <a href="#Constants">constants</a>.
For operations involving constants only, see the section on
<a href="#Constant_expressions">constant expressions</a>.
</p>

<p>
In a channel send, the first operand is always a channel and the
second is a value of the channel's element type.
</p>

<p>
Except for shift operations,
if one operand is an untyped <a href="#Constants">constant</a>
and the other operand is not, the constant is <a href="#Conversions">converted</a>
to the type of the other operand.
</p>

<p>
The right operand in a shift operation must have unsigned integer type
or be an untyped constant that can be converted to unsigned integer type.
</p>

<p>
If the left operand of a non-constant shift operation is an untyped constant,
the type of constant is what it would be if the shift operation were replaced by
the left operand alone.
</p>

<pre>
var s uint = 33;
var i = 1&lt;&lt;s;          // 1 has type int
var j = int32(1&lt;&lt;s);   // 1 has type int32; j == 0
var u = uint64(1&lt;&lt;s);  // 1 has type uint64; u == 1&lt;&lt;33
var f = float(1&lt;&lt;s);   // illegal: 1 has type float, cannot shift
var g = float(1&lt;&lt;33);  // legal; 1&lt;&lt;33 is a constant shift operation; g == 1&lt;&lt;33
</pre>

<h3 id="Operator_precedence">Operator precedence</h3>
<p>
Unary operators have the highest precedence.
As the  <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> operators form
statements, not expressions, they fall
outside the operator hierarchy.
As a consequence, statement <code>*p++</code> is the same as <code>(*p)++</code>.
<p>
There are six precedence levels for binary operators.
Multiplication operators bind strongest, followed by addition
operators, comparison operators, <code>&lt;-</code> (channel send),
<code>&amp;&amp;</code> (logical and), and finally <code>||</code> (logical or):
</p>

<pre class="grammar">
Precedence    Operator
    6             *  /  %  &lt;&lt;  &gt;&gt;  &amp;  &amp;^
    5             +  -  |  ^
    4             ==  !=  &lt;  &lt;=  >  >=
    3             &lt;-
    2             &amp;&amp;
    1             ||
</pre>

<p>
Binary operators of the same precedence associate from left to right.
For instance, <code>x / y * z</code> is the same as <code>(x / y) * z</code>.
</p>

<pre>
+x
23 + 3*x[i]
x &lt;= f()
^a &gt;&gt; b
f() || g()
x == y+1 &amp;&amp; &lt;-chan_ptr > 0
</pre>


<h3 id="Arithmetic_operators">Arithmetic operators</h3>
<p>
Arithmetic operators apply to numeric values and yield a result of the same
type as the first operand. The four standard arithmetic operators (<code>+</code>,
<code>-</code>,  <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>) apply to integer and
floating-point types; <code>+</code> also applies
to strings. All other arithmetic operators apply to integers only.
</p>

<pre class="grammar">
+    sum                    integers, floats, strings
-    difference             integers, floats
*    product                integers, floats
/    quotient               integers, floats

^    bitwise xor            integers
&amp;^   bit clear (and not)    integers

&lt;&lt;   left shift             integer &lt;&lt; unsigned integer
&gt;&gt;   right shift            integer &gt;&gt; unsigned integer
</pre>

<p>
Strings can be concatenated using the <code>+</code> operator
or the <code>+=</code> assignment operator:
</p>

<pre>
s := "hi" + string(c);
s += " and good bye";
</pre>

<p>
String addition creates a new string by concatenating the operands.
</p>
<p>
For integer values, <code>/</code> and <code>%</code> satisfy the following relationship:
</p>

<pre>
(a / b) * b + a % b == a
</pre>

<p>
with <code>(a / b)</code> truncated towards zero.
Examples:
</p>

<pre>
 x     y     x / y     x % y
 5     3       1         2
-5     3      -1        -2
 5    -3      -1         2
-5    -3       1        -2
</pre>

<p>
If the dividend is positive and the divisor is a constant power of 2,
the division may be replaced by a right shift, and computing the remainder may
be replaced by a bitwise "and" operation:
</p>

<pre>
 x     x / 4     x % 4     x &gt;&gt; 2     x &amp; 3
 11      2         3         2          3
-11     -2        -3        -3          1
</pre>

<p>
The shift operators shift the left operand by the shift count specified by the
right operand. They implement arithmetic shifts if the left operand is a signed
integer and logical shifts if it is an unsigned integer. The shift count must
be an unsigned integer. There is no upper limit on the shift count. Shifts behave
as if the left operand is shifted <code>n</code> times by 1 for a shift
count of <code>n</code>.
As a result, <code>x &lt;&lt; 1</code> is the same as <code>x*2</code>
and <code>x &gt;&gt; 1</code> is the same as
<code>x/2</code> truncated towards negative infinity.
</p>

<p>
For integer operands, the unary operators
<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, and <code>^</code> are defined as
follows:
</p>

<pre class="grammar">
+x                          is 0 + x
-x    negation              is 0 - x
^x    bitwise complement    is m ^ x  with m = "all bits set to 1" for unsigned x
                                      and  m = -1 for signed x
</pre>

<p>
For floating-point numbers,
<code>+x</code> is the same as <code>x</code>,
while <code>-x</code> is the negation of <code>x</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="Integer_overflow">Integer overflow</h3>

<p>
For unsigned integer values, the operations <code>+</code>,
<code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>&lt;&lt;</code> are
computed modulo 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>, where <i>n</i> is the bit width of
the unsigned integer's type
(§<a href="#Numeric_types">Numeric types</a>). Loosely speaking, these unsigned integer operations
discard high bits upon overflow, and programs may rely on ``wrap around''.
</p>
<p>
For signed integers, the operations <code>+</code>,
<code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>&lt;&lt;</code> may legally
overflow and the resulting value exists and is deterministically defined
by the signed integer representation, the operation, and its operands.
No exception is raised as a result of overflow. A
compiler may not optimize code under the assumption that overflow does
not occur. For instance, it may not assume that <code>x &lt; x + 1</code> is always true.
</p>


<h3 id="Comparison_operators">Comparison operators</h3>

<p>
Comparison operators yield a value of type <code>bool</code>.
The operators <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> apply, at least in some cases,
to operands of all types except arrays and structs.
All other comparison operators apply only to numeric and string values.
</p>

<pre class="grammar">
==    equal
!=    not equal
<     less
<=    less or equal
>     greater
>=    greater or equal
</pre>

<p>
Operands of numeric type are compared in the usual way.
</p>
<p>
Operands of string type are compared byte-wise (lexically).
</p>
<p>
Operands of boolean type are equal if they are either both <code>true</code>
or both <code>false</code>.
</p>
<p>
The rules for comparison of composite types are described in the
section on §<a href="#Comparison_compatibility">Comparison compatibility</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="Logical_operators">Logical operators</h3>

<p>
Logical operators apply to <a href="#Boolean_types">boolean</a> values
and yield a result of the same type as the operands.
The right operand is evaluated conditionally.
</p>

<pre class="grammar">
&amp;&amp;    conditional and    p &amp;&amp; q  is  "if p then q else false"
||    conditional or     p || q  is  "if p then true else q"
!     not                !p      is  "not p"
</pre>


<h3 id="Address_operators">Address operators</h3>

<p>
The address-of operator <code>&amp;</code> generates the address of its operand,
which must be <i>addressable</i>,
that is, either a variable, pointer indirection, array or slice indexing
operation,
or a field selector of an addressable struct operand.
A function result variable is not addressable.
(<font color=red>TODO: remove this restriction.</font>)
Given an operand of pointer type, the pointer indirection
operator <code>*</code> retrieves the value pointed
to by the operand.
</p>

<pre>
&amp;x
&amp;a[f(2)]
*p
*pf(x)
</pre>

<h3 id="Communication_operators">Communication operators</h3>

<p>
The term <i>channel</i> means "value of <a href="#Channel_types">channel type</a>".
</p>
<p>
The send operation uses the binary operator "&lt;-", which operates on
a channel and a value (expression):
</p>

<pre>
ch &lt;- 3
</pre>

<p>
The send operation sends the value on the channel.  Both the channel
and the expression are evaluated before communication begins.
Communication blocks until the send can proceed, at which point the
value is transmitted on the channel.
A send on an unbuffered channel can proceed if a receiver is ready.
A send on a buffered channel can proceed if there is room in the buffer.
</p>
<p>
If the send operation appears in an expression context, the value
of the expression is a boolean and the operation is non-blocking.
The value of the boolean reports true if the communication succeeded,
false if it did not. (The channel and
the expression to be sent are evaluated regardless.)
These two examples are equivalent:
</p>

<pre>
ok := ch &lt;- 3;
if ok { print("sent") } else { print("not sent") }

if ch &lt;- 3 { print("sent") } else { print("not sent") }
</pre>

<p>
In other words, if the program tests the value of a send operation,
the send is non-blocking and the value of the expression is the
success of the operation.  If the program does not test the value,
the operation blocks until it succeeds.
</p>
<p>
The receive operation uses the prefix unary operator "&lt;-".
The value of the expression is the value received, whose type
is the element type of the channel.
</p>

<pre>
&lt;-ch
</pre>

<p>
The expression blocks until a value is available, which then can
be assigned to a variable or used like any other expression.
If the receive expression does not save the value, the value is
discarded.
</p>

<pre>
v1 := &lt;-ch
v2 = &lt;-ch
f(&lt;-ch)
&lt;-strobe  // wait until clock pulse
</pre>

<p>
If a receive expression is used in an assignment or initialization of the form
</p>

<pre>
x, ok = &lt;-ch
x, ok := &lt;-ch
var x, ok = &lt;-ch
</pre>

<p>
the receive operation becomes non-blocking.
If the operation can proceed, the boolean variable
<code>ok</code> will be set to <code>true</code>
and the value stored in <code>x</code>; otherwise
<code>ok</code> is set
to <code>false</code> and <code>x</code> is set to the
zero value for its type (§<a href="#The_zero_value">The zero value</a>).
</p>

<p>
<font color=red>TODO: Probably in a separate section, communication semantics
need to be presented regarding send, receive, select, and goroutines.</font>
</p>

<h3 id="Method_expressions">Method expressions</h3>

<p>
If <code>M</code> is in the method set of type <code>T</code>,
<code>T.M</code> is a function that is callable as a regular function
with the same arguments as <code>M</code> prefixed by an additional
argument that is the receiver of the method.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
MethodExpr    = ReceiverType "." MethodName .
ReceiverType  = TypeName | "(" "*" TypeName ")" .
</pre>

<p>
Consider a struct type <code>T</code> with two methods,
<code>Mv</code>, whose receiver is of type <code>T</code>, and
<code>Mp</code>, whose receiver is of type <code>*T</code>.
</p>

<pre>
type T struct {
	a int;
}
func (tv  T) Mv(a int)   int   { return 0 }  // value receiver
func (tp *T) Mp(f float) float { return 1 }  // pointer receiver
var t T;
</pre>

<p>
The expression
</p>

<pre>
T.Mv
</pre>

<p>
yields a function equivalent to <code>Mv</code> but
with an explicit receiver as its first argument; it has signature
</p>

<pre>
func (tv T, a int) int
</pre>

<p>
That function may be called normally with an explicit receiver, so
these three invocations are equivalent:
</p>

<pre>
t.Mv(7)
T.Mv(t, 7)
f := T.Mv; f(t, 7)
</pre>

<p>
Similarly, the expression
</p>

<pre>
(*T).Mp
</pre>

<p>
yields a function value representing <code>Mp</code> with signature
</p>

<pre>
func (tp *T, f float) float
</pre>

<p>
For a method with a value receiver, one can derive a function
with an explicit pointer receiver, so
</p>

<pre>
(*T).Mv
</pre>

<p>
yields a function value representing <code>Mv</code> with signature
</p>

<pre>
func (tv *T, f int) int
</pre>

<p>
Such a function indirects through the receiver to create a value
to pass as the receiver to the underlying method;
the method does not overwrite the value whose address is passed in
the function call.
</p>

<p>
The final case, a value-receiver function for a pointer-receiver method,
is illegal because pointer-receiver methods are not in the method set
of the value type.
</p>

<p>
Function values derived from methods are called with function call syntax;
the receiver is provided as the first argument to the call.
That is, given <code>f := T.Mv</code>, <code>f</code> is invoked
as <code>f(t, 7)</code> not <code>t.f(7)</code>.
To construct a function that binds the receiver, use a
<a href="#Function_literals">closure</a>.
</p>

<p>
It is legal to derive a function value from a method of an interface type.
The resulting function takes an explicit receiver of that interface type.
</p>

<h3 id="Constant_expressions">Constant expressions</h3>

<p>
Constant expressions may contain only <a href="#Constants">constant</a>
operands and are evaluated at compile-time.
</p>

<p>
Untyped boolean, numeric, and string constants may be used as operands
wherever it is legal to use an operand of boolean, numeric, or string type,
respectively. Except for shift operations, if the operands of a binary operation
are an untyped integer constant and an untyped floating-point constant,
the integer constant is converted to an untyped floating-point constant
(relevant for <code>/</code> and <code>%</code>).
<p>

</p>
Applying an operator to untyped constants results in an untyped
constant of the same kind (that is, a boolean, integer, floating-point, or
string constant), except for
<a href="#Comparison_operators">comparison operators</a> which result in
a constant of type <code>bool</code>.
</p>

<p>
Constant expressions are always evaluated exactly; intermediate values and the
constants themselves may require precision significantly larger than supported
by any predeclared type in the language. The following are legal declarations:
</p>

<pre>
const Huge = 1 &lt;&lt; 100;
const Four int8 = Huge &gt;&gt; 98;
</pre>

<p>
The values of <i>typed</i> constants must always be accurately representable as values
of the constant type. The following constant expressions are illegal:
</p>

<pre>
uint(-1)       // -1 overflows uint
int(3.14)      // 3.14 truncated to integer
int64(Huge)    // 1&lt;&lt;100 overflows int64
Four * 300     // 300 overflows int8
Four * 100     // 400 overflows int8
</pre>

<p>
The mask used by the unary bitwise complement operator <code>^</code> matches
the rule for non-constants: the mask is all 1s for unsigned constants
and -1 for signed and untyped constants.
</p>

<pre>
^1          // untyped integer constant, equal to -2
uint8(^1)   // error, same as uint8(-2), out of range
^uint8(1)   // typed uint8 constant, same as 0xFF ^ uint8(1) = uint8(0xFE)
int8(^1)    // same as int8(-2)
^int8(1)    // same as -1 ^ int8(1) = -2
</pre>

<p>
<font color=red>
TODO: perhaps ^ should be disallowed on non-uints instead of assuming twos complement.
Also it may be possible to make typed constants more like variables, at the cost of fewer
overflow etc. errors being caught.
</font>
</p>


<h3 id="Order_of_evaluation">Order of evaluation</h3>

<p>
When evaluating the elements of an assignment or expression,
all function calls, method calls and
communication operations are evaluated in lexical left-to-right
order.  Otherwise, the order of evaluation is unspecified.
</p>

<p>
For example, in the assignment
</p>
<pre>
y[f()], ok = g(h(), i() + x[j()], &lt;-c), k()
</pre>
<p>
the function calls and communication happen in the order
<code>f()</code>, <code>h()</code>, <code>i()</code>, <code>j()</code>,
<code>&lt;-c</code>, <code>g()</code>, and <code>k()</code>.
However, the order of those events compared to the evaluation
and indexing of <code>x</code> and the evaluation
of <code>y</code> is not specified.

In assignment operations, both the left- and right-hand expression lists
must contain exactly one single-valued expression.
</p>

<pre>
a[i] &lt;&lt;= 2
i &amp;^= 1&lt;&lt;n
</pre>

<p>
A tuple assignment assigns the individual elements of a multi-valued
operation to a list of variables.  There are two forms.  In the
first, the right hand operand is a single multi-valued expression
such as a function evaluation or <a href="#Channel_types">channel</a> or
<a href="#Map_types">map</a> operation or a <a href="#Type_assertions">type assertion</a>.
The number of operands on the left
hand side must match the number of values.  For instance, if
<code>f</code> is a function returning two values,
</p>

<pre>
x, y = f()
</pre>

<p>
assigns the first value to <code>x</code> and the second to <code>y</code>.
The <a href="#Blank_identifier">blank identifier</a> provides a
way to ignore values returned by a multi-valued expression:
</p>

<pre>
x, _ = f()  // ignore second value returned by f()
</pre>

<p>
In the second form, the number of operands on the left must equal the number
of expressions on the right, each of which must be single-valued, and the
<i>n</i>th expression on the right is assigned to the <i>n</i>th
operand on the left.
The expressions on the right are evaluated before assigning to
any of the operands on the left, but otherwise the evaluation
order is unspecified beyond <a href="#Order_of_evaluation">the usual rules</a>.
</p>

<pre>
a, b = b, a  // exchange a and b
</pre>

<p>
In assignments, each value must be
<a href="#Assignment_compatibility">assignment compatible</a> with the type of the
operand to which it is assigned. If an untyped <a href="#Constants">constant</a>
is assigned to a variable of interface type, the constant is <a href="#Conversions">converted</a>
to type <code>bool</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, or <code>string</code>
respectively, depending on whether the value is a boolean, integer, floating-point,
or string constant.
</p>


<h3 id="If_statements">If statements</h3>

<p>
"If" statements specify the conditional execution of two branches
according to the value of a boolean expression.  If the expression
evaluates to true, the "if" branch is executed, otherwise, if
present, the "else" branch is executed.  A missing condition
is equivalent to <code>true</code>.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
IfStmt    = "if" [ SimpleStmt ";" ] [ Expression ] Block [ "else" Statement ] .
</pre>

<pre>
if x > 0 {
	return true;
}
</pre>

<p>
The expression may be preceded by a simple statement, which
executes before the expression is evaluated.
</p>

<pre>
if x := f(); x < y {
	return x;
} else if x > z {
	return z;
} else {
	return y;
}
</pre>


<h3 id="Switch_statements">Switch statements</h3>

<p>
"Switch" statements provide multi-way execution.
An expression or type specifier is compared to the "cases"
inside the "switch" to determine which branch
to execute.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
SwitchStmt = ExprSwitchStmt | TypeSwitchStmt .
</pre>

<p>
There are two forms: expression switches and type switches.
In an expression switch, the cases contain expressions that are compared
against the value of the switch expression.
In a type switch, the cases contain types that are compared against the
type of a specially annotated switch expression.
</p>

<h4 id="Expression_switches">Expression switches</h4>

<p>
In an expression switch,
the switch expression is evaluated and
the case expressions, which need not be constants,
are evaluated left-to-right and top-to-bottom; the first one that equals the
switch expression
triggers execution of the statements of the associated case;
the other cases are skipped.
If no case matches and there is a "default" case,
its statements are executed.
There can be at most one default case and it may appear anywhere in the
"switch" statement.
A missing expression is equivalent to
the expression <code>true</code>.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
ExprSwitchStmt = "switch" [ SimpleStmt ";" ] [ Expression ] "{" { ExprCaseClause } "}" .
ExprCaseClause = ExprSwitchCase ":" [ StatementList ] .
ExprSwitchCase = "case" ExpressionList | "default" .
</pre>

<p>
In a case or default clause,
the last statement only may be a "fallthrough" statement
(§<a href="#Fallthrough_statement">Fallthrough statement</a>) to
indicate that control should flow from the end of this clause to
the first statement of the next clause.
Otherwise control flows to the end of the "switch" statement.
</p>

<p>
The expression may be preceded by a simple statement, which
executes before the expression is evaluated.
</p>

<pre>
switch tag {
default: s3()
case 0, 1, 2, 3: s1()
case 4, 5, 6, 7: s2()
}

switch x := f(); {
case x &lt; 0: return -x
default: return x
}

switch {  // missing expression means "true"
case x &lt; y: f1();
case x &lt; z: f2();
case x == 4: f3();
}
</pre>

<h4 id="Type_switches">Type switches</h4>

<p>
A type switch compares types rather than values. It is otherwise similar
to an expression switch. It is marked by a special switch expression that
has the form of a <a href="#Type_assertions">type assertion</a>
using the reserved word <code>type</code> rather than an actual type.
Cases then match literal types against the dynamic type of the expression
in the type assertion.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
TypeSwitchStmt  = "switch" [ SimpleStmt ";" ] TypeSwitchGuard "{" { TypeCaseClause } "}" .
TypeSwitchGuard = [ identifier ":=" ] Expression "." "(" "type" ")" .
TypeCaseClause  = TypeSwitchCase ":" [ StatementList ] .
TypeSwitchCase  = "case" TypeList | "default" .
TypeList        = Type { "," Type } .
</pre>

<p>
The TypeSwitchGuard may include a
<a href="#Short_variable_declarations">short variable declaration</a>.
When that form is used, the variable is declared in each clause.
In clauses with a case listing exactly one type, the variable
has that type; otherwise, the variable has the type of the expression
in the TypeSwitchGuard.
</p>

<p>
The type in a case may be <code>nil</code>
(§<a href="#Predeclared_identifiers">Predeclared identifiers</a>);
that case is used when the expression in the TypeSwitchGuard
is a <code>nil</code> interface value.
</p>

<p>
Given a function <code>f</code> that returns
a value of type <code>interface{}</code>,
the following type switch:
</p>

<pre>
switch i := f().(type) {
case nil:
	printString("f() returns nil");
case int:
	printInt(i);  // i is an int
case float:
	printFloat(i);  // i is a float
case func(int) float:
	printFunction(i);  // i is a function
case bool, string:
	printString("type is bool or string");  // i is an interface{}
default:
	printString("don't know the type");
}
</pre>

<p>
could be rewritten:
</p>

<pre>
v := f();
if v == nil {
	printString("f() returns nil");
} else if i, is_int := v.(int); is_int {
	printInt(i);  // i is an int
} else if i, is_float := v.(float); is_float {
	printFloat(i);  // i is a float
} else if i, is_func := v.(func(int) float); is_func {
	printFunction(i);  // i is a function
} else {
	i1, is_bool := v.(bool);
	i2, is_string := v.(string);
	if is_bool || is_string {
		i := v;
		printString("type is bool or string");  // i is an interface{}
	} else {
		i := v;
		printString("don't know the type");  // i is an interface{}
	}
}
</pre>

<p>
The type switch guard may be preceded by a simple statement, which
executes before the guard is evaluated.
</p>

<p>
The "fallthrough" statement is not permitted in a type switch.
</p>

<h3 id="For_statements">For statements</h3>

<p>
A "for" statement specifies repeated execution of a block. The iteration is
controlled by a condition, a "for" clause, or a "range" clause.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
ForStmt = "for" [ Condition | ForClause | RangeClause ] Block .
Condition = Expression .
</pre>

<p>
In its simplest form, a "for" statement specifies the repeated execution of
a block as long as a boolean condition evaluates to true.
The condition is evaluated before each iteration.
If the condition is absent, it is equivalent to <code>true</code>.
</p>

<pre>
for a &lt; b {
	a *= 2
}
</pre>

<p>
A "for" statement with a ForClause is also controlled by its condition, but
additionally it may specify an <i>init</i>
and a <i>post</i> statement, such as an assignment,
an increment or decrement statement. The init statement may be a
<a href="#Short_variable_declarations">short variable declaration</a>, but the post statement must not.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
ForClause = InitStmt ";" [ Condition ] ";" PostStmt .
InitStmt = SimpleStmt .
PostStmt = SimpleStmt .
</pre>

<pre>
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
	f(i)
}
</pre>

<p>
If non-empty, the init statement is executed once before evaluating the
condition for the first iteration;
the post statement is executed after each execution of the block (and
only if the block was executed).
Any element of the ForClause may be empty but the semicolons are
required unless there is only a condition.
If the condition is absent, it is equivalent to <code>true</code>.
</p>

<pre>
for cond { S() }    is the same as    for ; cond ; { S() }
for      { S() }    is the same as    for true     { S() }
</pre>

<p>
A "for" statement with a "range" clause
iterates through all entries of an array, slice, string or map,
or values received on a channel.
For each entry it first assigns the current index or key to an iteration
variable - or the current (index, element) or (key, value) pair to a pair
of iteration variables - and then executes the block.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
RangeClause = ExpressionList ( "=" | ":=" ) "range" Expression .
</pre>

<p>
The type of the right-hand expression in the "range" clause must be an
array, slice, string or map, or a pointer to an array;
or it may be a channel.
Except for channels,
the identifier list must contain one or two expressions
(as in assignments, these must be a
variable, pointer indirection, field selector, or index expression)
denoting the
iteration variables. On each iteration,
the first variable is set to the string, array or slice index or
map key, and the second variable, if present, is set to the corresponding
string or array element or map value.
The types of the array or slice index (always <code>int</code>)
and element, or of the map key and value respectively,
must be <a href="#Assignment_compatibility">assignment compatible</a> to the iteration variables.
</p>
<p>
For strings, the "range" clause iterates over the Unicode code points
in the string.  On successive iterations, the index variable will be the
index of the first byte of successive UTF-8-encoded code points in the string, and
the second variable, of type <code>int</code>, will be the value of
the corresponding code point.  If the iteration encounters an invalid
UTF-8 sequence, the second variable will be <code>0xFFFD</code>,
the Unicode replacement character, and the next iteration will advance
a single byte in the string.
</p>
<p>
For channels, the identifier list must contain one identifier.
The iteration receives values sent on the channel until the channel is closed;
it does not process the zero value sent before the channel is closed.
</p>
<p>
The iteration variables may be declared by the "range" clause (":="), in which
case their scope ends at the end of the "for" statement (§<a href="#Declarations_and">Declarations and</a>
scope rules). In this case their types are set to
<code>int</code> and the array element type, or the map key and value types, respectively.
If the iteration variables are declared outside the "for" statement,
after execution their values will be those of the last iteration.
</p>

<pre>
var a [10]string;
m := map[string]int{"mon":0, "tue":1, "wed":2, "thu":3, "fri":4, "sat":5, "sun":6};

for i, s := range a {
	// type of i is int
	// type of s is string
	// s == a[i]
	g(i, s)
}

var key string;
var val interface {};  // value type of m is assignment compatible to val
for key, val = range m {
	h(key, val)
}
// key == last map key encountered in iteration
// val == map[key]
</pre>

<p>
If map entries that have not yet been processed are deleted during iteration,
they will not be processed. If map entries are inserted during iteration, the
behavior is implementation-dependent, but each entry will be processed at most once.
</p>

<h3 id="Go_statements">Go statements</h3>

<p>
A "go" statement starts the execution of a function or method call
as an independent concurrent thread of control, or <i>goroutine</i>,
within the same address space.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
GoStmt = "go" Expression .
</pre>

<p>
The expression must be a call, and
unlike with a regular call, program execution does not wait
for the invoked function to complete.
</p>

<pre>
go Server()
go func(ch chan&lt;- bool) { for { sleep(10); ch &lt;- true; }} (c)
</pre>


<h3 id="Select_statements">Select statements</h3>

<p>
A "select" statement chooses which of a set of possible communications
will proceed.  It looks similar to a "switch" statement but with the
cases all referring to communication operations.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
SelectStmt = "select" "{" { CommClause } "}" .
CommClause = CommCase ":" StatementList .
CommCase = "case" ( SendExpr | RecvExpr) | "default" .
SendExpr =  Expression "&lt;-" Expression .
RecvExpr =  [ Expression ( "=" | ":=" ) ] "&lt;-" Expression .
</pre>

<p>
For all the send and receive expressions in the "select"
statement, the channel expressions are evaluated, along with
any expressions that appear on the right hand side of send expressions,
in top-to-bottom order.
If any of the resulting operations can proceed, one is
chosen and the corresponding communication and statements are
evaluated.  Otherwise, if there is a default case, that executes;
if not, the statement blocks until one of the communications can
complete.  The channels and send expressions are not re-evaluated.
A channel pointer may be <code>nil</code>,
which is equivalent to that case not
being present in the select statement
except, if a send, its expression is still evaluated.
</p>
<p>
Since all the channels and send expressions are evaluated, any side
effects in that evaluation will occur for all the communications
in the "select" statement.
</p>
<p>
If multiple cases can proceed, a uniform fair choice is made to decide
which single communication will execute.
<p>
The receive case may declare a new variable using a
<a href="#Short_variable_declarations">short variable declaration</a>.
</p>

<pre>
var c, c1, c2 chan int;
var i1, i2 int;
select {
case i1 = &lt;-c1:
	print("received ", i1, " from c1\n");
case c2 &lt;- i2:
	print("sent ", i2, " to c2\n");
default:
	print("no communication\n");
}

for {  // send random sequence of bits to c
	select {
	case c &lt;- 0:  // note: no statement, no fallthrough, no folding of cases
	case c &lt;- 1:
	}
}
</pre>


<h3 id="Return_statements">Return statements</h3>

<p>
A "return" statement terminates execution of the containing function
and optionally provides a result value or values to the caller.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
ReturnStmt = "return" [ ExpressionList ] .
</pre>

<p>
In a function without a result type, a "return" statement must not
specify any result values.
</p>
<pre>
func no_result() {
	return
}
</pre>

<p>
There are three ways to return values from a function with a result
type:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>The return value or values may be explicitly listed
		in the "return" statement. Each expression must be single-valued
		and <a href="#Assignment_compatibility">assignment compatible</a> to the corresponding element of
		the result type of the function.
<pre>
func simple_f() int {
	return 2
}

func complex_f1() (re float, im float) {
	return -7.0, -4.0
}
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>The expression list in the "return" statement may be a single
		call to a multi-valued function. The effect is as if each value
		returned from that function were assigned to a temporary
		variable with the type of the respective value, followed by a
		"return" statement listing these variables, at which point the
		rules of the previous case apply.
<pre>
func complex_f2() (re float, im float) {
	return complex_f1()
}
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>The expression list may be empty if the functions's result
		type specifies names for its result parameters (§<a href="#Function_Types">Function Types</a>).
		The result parameters act as ordinary local variables that are
		initialized to the zero values for their type (§<a href="#The_zero_value">The zero value</a>)
		and the function may assign values to them as necessary.
		The "return" statement returns the values of these variables.
<pre>
func complex_f3() (re float, im float) {
	re = 7.0;
	im = 4.0;
	return;

<h3 id="Break_statements">Break statements</h3>

<p>
A "break" statement terminates execution of the innermost
"for", "switch" or "select" statement.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
BreakStmt = "break" [ Label ].
</pre>

<p>
If there is a label, it must be that of an enclosing
"for", "switch" or "select" statement, and that is the one whose execution
terminates
(§<a href="#For_statements">For statements</a>, §<a href="#Switch_statements">Switch statements</a>, §<a href="#Select_statements">Select statements</a>).

	switch i {
		case 5: break L

<h3 id="Continue_statements">Continue statements</h3>

<p>
A "continue" statement begins the next iteration of the
innermost "for" loop at its post statement (§<a href="#For_statements">For statements</a>).
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
ContinueStmt = "continue" [ Label ].
</pre>

<p>
The optional label is analogous to that of a "break" statement.

<p>
A "goto" statement transfers control to the statement with the corresponding label.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
GotoStmt = "goto" Label .
</pre>

<pre>
goto Error
</pre>

<p>
Executing the "goto" statement must not cause any variables to come into
scope that were not already in scope at the point of the goto.  For
instance, this example:
</p>

<pre>
goto L;  // BAD
v := 3;
L:
</pre>

<p>
is erroneous because the jump to label <code>L</code> skips
the creation of <code>v</code>.
(<font color=red>TODO: Eliminate in favor of used and not set errors?</font>)
</p>

<h3 id="Fallthrough_statements">Fallthrough statements</h3>

<p>
A "fallthrough" statement transfers control to the first statement of the
next case clause in a expression "switch" statement (§<a href="#Expression_switches">Expression switches</a>). It may
be used only as the final non-empty statement in a case or default clause in an
expression "switch" statement.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
FallthroughStmt = "fallthrough" .

<h3 id="Defer_statements">Defer statements</h3>

<p>
A "defer" statement invokes a function whose execution is deferred to the moment
the surrounding function returns.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
DeferStmt = "defer" Expression .
</pre>

<p>
The expression must be a function or method call.
Each time the "defer" statement
executes, the parameters to the function call are evaluated and saved anew but the
function is not invoked.
Deferred function calls are executed in LIFO order
immediately before the surrounding function returns,
but after the return values, if any, have been evaluated.
</p>

<pre>
lock(l);
defer unlock(l);  // unlocking happens before surrounding function returns

<p>
The type of the result is always <code>int</code> and the
implementation guarantees that
the result always fits into an <code>int</code>.
<p>
The capacity of a slice or map is the number of elements for which there is
space allocated in the underlying array (for a slice) or map. For a slice
<code>s</code>, at any time the following relationship holds:

<pre>
0 <= len(s) <= cap(s)
</pre>


<h3 id="Conversions">Conversions</h3>

<p>
Conversions look like function calls of the form
</p>

<pre>
T(value)
</pre>

<p>
where <code>T</code> is a type
and <code>value</code> is an expression
that can be converted to a value
of result type <code>T</code>.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
Conversion = ( TypeName | "(" Type ")" ) Expression .
</pre>

<p>
The following conversion rules apply:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
1) The conversion succeeds if the value is <a href="#Assignment_compatibility">assignment compatible</a>
with type <code>T</code>.
</li>
<li>
2) The conversion succeeds if the value would be assignment compatible
with type <code>T</code> if the value's type, or <code>T</code>, or any of their component
types were unnamed (§<a href="#Type_identity_and_compatibility">Type identity and compatibility</a>).
</li>
<li>
3) Between integer types.  If the value is a signed quantity, it is
sign extended to implicit infinite precision; otherwise it is zero
extended.  It is then truncated to fit in the result type's size.
For example, if <code>x := uint16(0x10F0)</code>, then <code>uint32(int8(x)) == 0xFFFFFFF0</code>.
The conversion always yields a valid value; there is no indication of overflow.
</li>
<li>
4) Between integer and floating-point types, or between floating-point types.
When converting a floating-point number to an integer, the fraction is discarded
(truncation towards zero).
In all conversions involving floating-point values, if the result type cannot represent the
value the conversion succeeds but the result value is unspecified.
<font color=red>This behavior may change.</font>
</li>
<li>
5) Strings permit three special conversions:
</li>
<li>
5a) Converting an integer value yields a string containing the UTF-8
representation of the integer.

<pre>
string(0x65e5)  // "\u65e5" == "日" == "\xe6\x97\xa5"
</pre>

</li>
<li>
5b) Converting a slice of integers yields a string that is the
concatenation of the individual integers converted to strings.
If the slice value is <code>nil</code>, the result is the empty string.
<pre>
string([]int{0x767d, 0x9d6c, 0x7fd4})  // "\u767d\u9d6c\u7fd4" == "白鵬翔"</pre>
</li>

<li>
5c) Converting a slice of bytes yields a string whose successive
bytes are those of the slice. If the slice value is <code>nil</code>,
the result is the empty string.

<pre>
string([]byte{'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'})  // "hello"
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

There is no linguistic mechanism to convert between pointers and integers.
The package <a href="#Package_unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a>

<h3 id="Allocation">Allocation</h3>

<p>
The built-in function <code>new</code> takes a type <code>T</code> and
returns a value of type <code>*T</code>.
The memory is initialized as described in the section on initial values
(§<a href="#The_zero_value">The zero value</a>).
</p>

<pre>
new(T)
</pre>

<p>
For instance
</p>

<pre>
type S struct { a int; b float }
new(S)
</pre>

<p>
dynamically allocates memory for a variable of type <code>S</code>,
initializes it (<code>a=0</code>, <code>b=0.0</code>),
and returns a value of type <code>*S</code> containing the address
of the memory.
</p>

<h3 id="Making_slices_maps_and_channels">Making slices, maps and channels</h3>

<p>
Slices, maps and channels are reference types that do not require the
extra indirection of an allocation with <code>new</code>.
The built-in function <code>make</code> takes a type <code>T</code>,
which must be a slice, map or channel type,
optionally followed by a type-specific list of expressions.
It returns a value of type <code>T</code> (not <code>*T</code>).
The memory is initialized as described in the section on initial values
(§<a href="#The_zero_value">The zero value</a>).

<pre>
make(T [, optional list of expressions])

The parameters affect sizes for allocating slices, maps, and
buffered channels:
</p>

<pre>
s := make([]int, 10, 100);        # slice with len(s) == 10, cap(s) == 100
s := make([]int, 10);             # slice with len(s) == cap(s) == 10
c := make(chan int, 10);          # channel with a buffer size of 10
m := make(map[string] int, 100);  # map with initial space for 100 elements

<h2 id="Packages">Packages</h2>

<p>
Go programs are constructed by linking together <i>packages</i>.
A package is in turn constructed from one or more source files that
together provide access to a set of types, constants, functions,
and variables.  Those elements may be <i>exported</i> and used in
another package.
</p>

<h3 id="Source_file_organization">Source file organization</h3>

<p>
Each source file consists of a package clause defining the package
to which it belongs, followed by a possibly empty set of import
declarations that declare packages whose contents it wishes to use,
followed by a possibly empty set of declarations of functions,
types, variables, and constants.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
SourceFile       = PackageClause { ImportDecl [ ";" ] } { TopLevelDecl [ ";" ] } .
</pre>

<h3 id="Package_clause">Package clause</h3>

<p>
A package clause begins each source file and defines the package
to which the file belongs.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
PackageClause  = "package" PackageName .
PackageName    = identifier .
</pre>

<p>
The PackageName must not be the <a href="#Blank_identifier">blank identifier</a>.
</p>

<pre>
package math
</pre>

<p>
A set of files sharing the same PackageName form the implementation of a package.
An implementation may require that all source files for a package inhabit the same directory.
</p>

<h3 id="Import_declarations">Import declarations</h3>

<p>
A source file gains access to <a href="#Exported_identifiers">exported identifiers</a>
from another package through an import declaration.
In the general form, an import declaration provides an identifier
that code in the source file may use to access the imported package's
contents and a file name referring to the (compiled) implementation of
the package.  The file name may be relative to a repository of
installed packages.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
ImportDecl       = "import" ( ImportSpec | "(" [ ImportSpecList ] ")" ) .
ImportSpecList   = ImportSpec { ";" ImportSpec } [ ";" ] .
ImportSpec       = [ "." | PackageName ] PackageFileName .
PackageFileName  = StringLit .
</pre>

<p>
After an import, in the usual case an exported name <i>N</i> from the imported
package <i>P</i> may be accessed by the qualified identifier
<i>P</i><code>.</code><i>N</i> (§<a href="#Qualified_identifiers">Qualified identifiers</a>).  The actual
name <i>P</i> depends on the form of the import declaration.  If
an explicit package name <code>p1</code> is provided, the qualified
identifer will have the form <code>p1.</code><i>N</i>.  If no name
is provided in the import declaration, <i>P</i> will be the package
name declared within the source files of the imported package.
Finally, if the import declaration uses an explicit period
(<code>.</code>) for the package name, <i>N</i> will be declared
in the current file's file block and can be accessed without a qualifier.
</p>

<p>
In this table, assume we have compiled a package named
<code>math</code>, which exports function <code>Sin</code>, and
installed the compiled package in file
<code>"lib/math"</code>.
</p>

<pre class="grammar">
Import syntax               Local name of Sin

import M "lib/math"         M.Sin
import   "lib/math"         math.Sin
import . "lib/math"         Sin
</pre>

<h3 id="Multiple-file_packages">Multiple-file packages</h3>

<p>
If a package is constructed from multiple source files,
all names declared in the package block, not just uppercase ones,
are in scope in all the files in the package.
</p>

<p>
If source file <code>math1.go</code> contains
</p>
<pre>
package math

const twoPi = 6.283185307179586

function Sin(x float) float { return ... }
</pre>

<p>
then a second file <code>math2.go</code> also in
<code>package math</code>
may refer directly to <code>Sin</code> and <code>twoPi</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="An_example_package">An example package</h3>

<p>
Here is a complete Go package that implements a concurrent prime sieve.
</p>

<pre>
package main

import "fmt"

// Send the sequence 2, 3, 4, ... to channel 'ch'.
func generate(ch chan&lt;- int) {
	for i := 2; ; i++ {
		ch &lt;- i;	// Send 'i' to channel 'ch'.
	}
}

// Copy the values from channel 'in' to channel 'out',
// removing those divisible by 'prime'.
func filter(src &lt;-chan int, dst chan&lt;- int, prime int) {
	for i := range src {	// Loop over values received from 'src'.
		if i%prime != 0 {
			dst &lt;- i;	// Send 'i' to channel 'dst'.
		}
	}
}

// The prime sieve: Daisy-chain filter processes together.
func sieve() {
	ch := make(chan int);	// Create a new channel.
	go generate(ch);	// Start generate() as a subprocess.
	for {
		prime := &lt;-ch;
		fmt.Print(prime, "\n");
		ch1 := make(chan int);
		go filter(ch, ch1, prime);
		ch = ch1;
	}
}

func main() {
	sieve();
}
</pre>

<h2 id="Program_initialization_and_execution">Program initialization and execution</h2>

<h3 id="The_zero_value">The zero value</h3>
<p>
When memory is allocated to store a value, either through a declaration
or <code>make()</code> or <code>new()</code> call,
and no explicit initialization is provided, the memory is
given a default initialization.  Each element of such a value is
set to the <i>zero value</i> for its type: <code>false</code> for booleans,
<code>0</code> for integers, <code>0.0</code> for floats, <code>""</code>
for strings, and <code>nil</code> for pointers, functions, interfaces, slices, channels, and maps.
This initialization is done recursively, so for instance each element of an
array of structs will have its fields zeroed if no value is specified.
</p>
<p>
These two simple declarations are equivalent:
</p>

<pre>
var i int;
var i int = 0;
</pre>

<p>
After
</p>

<pre>
type T struct { i int; f float; next *T };
t := new(T);
</pre>

<p>
the following holds:
</p>

<pre>
t.i == 0
t.f == 0.0
t.next == nil
</pre>

<p>
The same would also be true after
</p>

<pre>
var t T
</pre>

<h3 id="Program_execution">Program execution</h3>
<p>
A package with no imports is initialized by assigning initial values to
all its package-level variables
and then calling any
package-level function with the name and signature of
</p>
<pre>
func init()
</pre>
<p>
defined in its source. Since a package may contain more
than one source file, there may be more than one
<code>init()</code> function in a package, but
only one per source file.
</p>
<p>
Within a package, package-level variables are initialized,
and constant values are determined, in
data-dependent order: if the initializer of <code>A</code>
depends on the value of <code>B</code>, <code>A</code>
will be set after <code>B</code>.
It is an error if such dependencies form a cycle.
Dependency analysis is done lexically: <code>A</code>
depends on <code>B</code> if the value of <code>A</code>
contains a mention of <code>B</code>, contains a value
whose initializer
mentions <code>B</code>, or mentions a function that
mentions <code>B</code>, recursively.
If two items are not interdependent, they will be initialized
in the order they appear in the source.
Since the dependency analysis is done per package, it can produce
unspecified results  if <code>A</code>'s initializer calls a function defined
in another package that refers to <code>B</code>.
</p>
<p>
Initialization code may contain "go" statements, but the functions
they invoke do not begin execution until initialization of the entire
program is complete. Therefore, all initialization code is run in a single
goroutine.
</p>
<p>
An <code>init()</code> function cannot be referred to from anywhere
in a program. In particular, <code>init()</code> cannot be called explicitly,
nor can a pointer to <code>init</code> be assigned to a function variable.
</p>
<p>
If a package has imports, the imported packages are initialized
before initializing the package itself. If multiple packages import
a package <code>P</code>, <code>P</code> will be initialized only once.
</p>
<p>
The importing of packages, by construction, guarantees that there can
be no cyclic dependencies in initialization.
</p>
<p>
A complete program, possibly created by linking multiple packages,
must have one package called <code>main</code>, with a function
</p>

<pre>
func main() { ... }
</pre>

<p>
defined.
The function <code>main.main()</code> takes no arguments and returns no value.
</p>
<p>
Program execution begins by initializing the <code>main</code> package and then
invoking <code>main.main()</code>.
</p>
<p>
When <code>main.main()</code> returns, the program exits.
</p>
<p>
Implementation restriction: The compiler assumes package <code>main</code>
is not imported by any other package.
</p>

<h2 id="System_considerations">System considerations</h2>

<h3 id="Package_unsafe">Package <code>unsafe</code></h3>

<p>
The built-in package <code>unsafe</code>, known to the compiler,
provides facilities for low-level programming including operations
that violate the type system. A package using <code>unsafe</code>
must be vetted manually for type safety.  The package provides the
following interface:
</p>

<pre class="grammar">
package unsafe

type ArbitraryType int  // shorthand for an arbitrary Go type; it is not a real type
type Pointer *ArbitraryType

func Alignof(variable ArbitraryType) int
func Offsetof(selector ArbitraryType) int
func Sizeof(variable ArbitraryType) int

func Reflect(val interface {}) (typ runtime.Type, addr uintptr)
func Typeof(val interface {}) reflect.Type
func Unreflect(typ runtime.Type, addr uintptr) interface{}
</pre>

<p>
Any pointer or value of type <code>uintptr</code> can be converted into
a <code>Pointer</code> and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
The function <code>Sizeof</code> takes an expression denoting a
variable of any type and returns the size of the variable in bytes.
</p>
<p>
The function <code>Offsetof</code> takes a selector (§<a href="#Selectors">Selectors</a>) denoting a struct
field of any type and returns the field offset in bytes relative to the
struct's address.
For a struct <code>s</code> with field <code>f</code>:
</p>

<pre>
uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&amp;s)) + uintptr(unsafe.Offsetof(s.f)) == uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&amp;s.f))
</pre>

<p>
Computer architectures may require memory addresses to be <i>aligned</i>;
that is, for addresses of a variable to be a multiple of a factor,
the variable's type's <i>alignment</i>.  The function <code>Alignof</code>
takes an expression denoting a variable of any type and returns the
alignment of the (type of the) variable in bytes.  For a variable
<code>x</code>:
</p>

<pre>
uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&amp;x)) % uintptr(unsafe.Alignof(x)) == 0
</pre>

<p>
Calls to <code>Alignof</code>, <code>Offsetof</code>, and
<code>Sizeof</code> are compile-time constant expressions of type <code>int</code>.
</p>
<p>
The functions <code>unsafe.Typeof</code>,
<code>unsafe.Reflect</code>,
and <code>unsafe.Unreflect</code> allow access at run time to the dynamic 
types and values stored in interfaces.
<code>Typeof</code> returns a representation of
<code>val</code>'s
dynamic type as a <code>runtime.Type</code>.
<code>Reflect</code> allocates a copy of
<code>val</code>'s dynamic
value and returns both the type and the address of the copy.
<code>Unreflect</code> inverts <code>Reflect</code>,
creating an
interface value from a type and address.
The <code>reflect</code> package built on these primitives
provides a safe, more convenient way to inspect interface values.
</p>


<h3 id="Size_and_alignment_guarantees">Size and alignment guarantees</h3>

For the numeric types (§<a href="#Numeric_types">Numeric types</a>), the following sizes are guaranteed:

<pre class="grammar">
type                      size in bytes

byte, uint8, int8         1
uint16, int16             2
uint32, int32, float32    4
uint64, int64, float64    8
</pre>

<p>
The following minimal alignment properties are guaranteed:
</p>
<ol>
<li>For a variable <code>x</code> of any type: <code>1 <= unsafe.Alignof(x) <= unsafe.Maxalign</code>.

<li>For a variable <code>x</code> of numeric type: <code>unsafe.Alignof(x)</code> is the smaller
   of <code>unsafe.Sizeof(x)</code> and <code>unsafe.Maxalign</code>, but at least 1.

<li>For a variable <code>x</code> of struct type: <code>unsafe.Alignof(x)</code> is the largest of
   all the values <code>unsafe.Alignof(x.f)</code> for each field <code>f</code> of x, but at least 1.

<li>For a variable <code>x</code> of array type: <code>unsafe.Alignof(x)</code> is the same as
   <code>unsafe.Alignof(x[0])</code>, but at least 1.
</ol>
