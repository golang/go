Several new scheduler metrics have been added, including counts of
goroutines in various states (waiting, runnable, etc.) under the
`/sched/goroutines` prefix, the number of OS threads the runtime is
aware of with `/sched/threads:threads`, and the total number of
goroutines created by the program with
`/sched/goroutines-created:goroutines`.
