The [`debug.SetCrashOutput`](/runtime#SetCrashOutput) function allows
the user to specify an alternate file to which the runtime should
write its fatal crash report
([#42888](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42888)).
It may be used to construct an automated reporting mechanism for all
unexpected crashes, not just those in goroutines that explicitly use
`recover`.
