The new [BasicLit.ValueEnd] field records the precise end position of
a literal so that the [BasicLit.End] method can now always return the
correct answer. (Previously it was computed using a heuristic that was
incorrect for multi-line raw string literals in Windows source files,
due to removal of carriage returns.)
