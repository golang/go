The new [BasicLit.ValueEnd] field records the precise end position of
a literal so that the [BasicLit.End] method can now always return the
correct answer. (Previously it was computed using a heuristic that was
incorrect for multi-line raw string literals in Windows source files,
due to removal of carriage returns.)

Programs that update the `ValuePos` field of `BasicLit`s produced by
the parser may need to also update or clear the `ValueEnd` field to
avoid minor differences in formatted output. <!-- #76395 --->
