The following GODEBUG settings introduced in [Go 1.22](/doc/godebug#go-122)
and [Go 1.23](/doc/godebug#go-123) will be removed in the next major Go release.
Starting in Go 1.27, the new behavior will apply regardless of GODEBUG setting or go.mod language version.

- `tlsunsafeekm`: [ConnectionState.ExportKeyingMaterial] will require TLS 1.3 or Extended Master Secret.
- `tlsrsakex`: legacy RSA-only key exchanges without ECDH won't be enabled by default.
- `tls10server`: the default minimum TLS version for both clients and servers will be TLS 1.2.
- `tls3des`: the default cipher suites will not include 3DES.
- `x509keypairleaf`: [X509KeyPair] and [LoadX509KeyPair] will always populate the [Certificate.Leaf] field.
