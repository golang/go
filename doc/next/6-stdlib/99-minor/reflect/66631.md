[reflect.Type] includes new methods that return iterators for a type's fields, methods, inputs and outputs.
[reflect.Value.Fields] and [reflect.Value.Methods] have also been introduced, these return iterators which
yield both a [reflect.Value] as well as the corresponding [reflect.StructField] or [reflect.Method].
