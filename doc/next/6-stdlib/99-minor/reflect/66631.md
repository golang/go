[reflect.Type] includes new methods that return iterators for a type's fields, methods, inputs and outputs.
Similarly, [reflect.Value] includes two new methods that return iterators over a value's fields or methods, 
each element being a pair of the value ([reflect.Value]) and its type information ([reflect.StructField] or 
[reflect.Method]).
