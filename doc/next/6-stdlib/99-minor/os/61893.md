On Windows, the mode bits reported by [Lstat] and [Stat] for
reparse points changed. Mount points no longer have [ModeSymlink] set,
and reparse points that are not symlinks, Unix sockets, or dedup files
now always have [ModeIrregular] set.
This behavior is controlled by the `winsymlink` setting.
For Go 1.23, it defaults to `winsymlink=1`.
Previous versions default to `winsymlink=0`.
