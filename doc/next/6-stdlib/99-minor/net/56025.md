[LookupMX] and [(*Resolver).LookupMX] now return DNS names that look
like valid IP address, as well as valid domain names.
Previously if a name server returned an IP address as a DNS name,
LookupMX would discard it, as required by the RFCs.
However, name servers in practice do sometimes return IP addresses.
