HTTP/2 server now accepts client priority signals, as defined in RFC 9218,
allowing it to prioritize serving HTTP/2 streams with higher priority. If the
old behavior is preferred, where streams are served in a round-robin manner
regardless of priority, [Server.DisableClientPriority] can be set to `true`.
