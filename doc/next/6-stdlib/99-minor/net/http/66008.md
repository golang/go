The new [ParseCookie] function parses a Cookie header value and
returns all the cookies which were set in it. Since the same cookie
name can appear multiple times the returned Values can contain
more than one value for a given key.

The new [ParseSetCookie] function parses a Set-Cookie header value and
returns a cookie. It returns an error on syntax error.
