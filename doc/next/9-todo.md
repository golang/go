all: add GORISCV64 environment variable  
cmd/go: add rva23u64 as a valid value for GORISCV64  
The RVA23 profile was ratified on the 21st of October 2024.
https://riscv.org/announcements/2024/10/risc-v-announces-ratification-of-the-rva23-profile-standard/
Now that it's ratified we can add rva23u64 as a valid value for the
GORISCV64 environment variable. This will allow the compiler and
assembler to generate instructions made mandatory by the new profile
without a runtime check.  Examples of such instructions include those
introduced by the Vector and Zicond extensions.
Setting GORISCV64=rva23u64 defines the riscv64.rva20u64,
riscv64.rva22u64 and riscv64.rva23u64 build tags, sets the internal
variable buildcfg.GORISCV64 to 23 and defines the macros
GORISCV64_rva23u64, hasV, hasZba, hasZbb, hasZbs, hasZfa, and
hasZicond for use in assembly language code.

errgroup: propagate panic and Goexit through Wait  
Recovered panic values are wrapped and saved in Group.
Goexits are detected by a sentinel value set after the given function

with a bool, if f not call runtime.Goexit, is true,
