<pre>
Several package changes in this release may require you to update your code if
you use the bytes, template, or utf8 packages. In all cases, any outdated code
will fail to compile rather than behave erroneously.

The bytes package has changed. Its Add and AddByte functions have been removed,
as their functionality is provided by the recently-introduced built-in function
“append”. Any code that uses them will need to be changed:
s = bytes.Add(s, b)    ->    s = append(s, b...)
s = bytes.AddByte(b, c)    ->    s = append(s, b)
s = bytes.Add(nil, c)    ->    append([]byte(nil), c)

The template package has changed. Your code will need to be updated if it calls
the HTMLFormatter or StringFormatter functions, or implements its own formatter
functions. The function signature for formatter types has changed to:
        func(wr io.Writer, formatter string, data ...interface{})
to allow multiple arguments to the formatter.  No templates will need updating.
See the change for examples:
        http://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=2c2be793120e

The template change permits the implementation of multi-word variable
instantiation for formatters. Before one could say
        {field}
or
        {field|formatter}
Now one can also say
        {field1 field2 field3}
or
        {field1 field2 field3|formatter}
and the fields are passed as successive arguments to the formatter,
by analogy to fmt.Print.

The utf8 package has changed. The order of EncodeRune’s arguments has been
reversed to satisfy the convention of “destination first”.
Any code that uses EncodeRune will need to be updated.

<h3 id="2010-11-10">2010-11-10</h3>

<pre>
The birthday release includes a new Search capability inside the sort package.
It takes an unusual but very general and easy-to-use approach to searching
arbitrary indexable sorted data.  See the documentation for details:
    http://golang.org/pkg/sort/#Search

The ARM port now uses the hardware floating point unit (VFP).  It still has a
few bugs, mostly around conversions between unsigned integer and floating-point
values, but it's stabilizing.

In addition, there have been many smaller fixes and updates: 

* 6l: generate dwarf variable names with disambiguating suffix.
* container/list: make Remove return Value of removed element.
    makes it easier to remove first or last item.
* crypto: add cast5 (default PGP cipher),
    switch block cipher methods to be destination first.
* crypto/tls: use pool building for certificate checking
* go/ast: change embedded token.Position fields to named fields
    (preparation for a different position representation)
* net: provide public access to file descriptors (thanks Keith Rarick)
* os: add Expand function to evaluate environment variables.
* path: add Glob (thanks Benny Siegert)
* runtime: memequal optimization (thanks Graham Miller)
    prefix all external symbols with "runtime·" to avoid
    conflicts linking with external C libraries.

<h3 id="2010-11-02">2010-11-02</h3>

<pre>

<h3 id="2010-10-27">2010-10-27</h3>

*** This release changes the encoding used by package gob. 
    If you store gobs on disk, see below. ***

The ARM port (5g) now passes all tests. The optimizer is not yet enabled, and
floating point arithmetic is performed entirely in software. Work is underway
to address both of these deficiencies.

The syntax for arrays, slices, and maps of composite literals has been
simplified. Within a composite literal of array, slice, or map type, elements
that are themselves composite literals may elide the type if it is identical to
the outer literal’s element type. For example, these expressions:
	[][]int{[]int{1, 2, 3}, []int{4, 5}}
	map[string]Point{“x”: Point{1.5, -3.5}, “y”: Point{0, 0}}
can be simplified to:
	[][]int{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5}}
	map[string]Point{“x”: {1.5, -3.5}, “y”: {0, 0}}
Gofmt can make these simplifications mechanically when invoked with the 
new -s flag.

The built-in copy function can now copy bytes from a string value to a []byte.
Code like this (for []byte b and string s): 
	for i := 0; i < len(s); i++ {
		b[i] = s[i]
	}
can be rewritten as:
	copy(b, s)

The gob package can now encode and decode interface values containing types
registered ahead of time with the new Register function. These changes required
a backwards-incompatible change to the wire format.  Data written with the old
version of the package will not be readable with the new one, and vice versa.
(Steps were made in this change to make sure this doesn’t happen again.) 
We don’t know of anyone using gobs to create permanent data, but if you do this
and need help converting, please let us know, and do not update to this release
yet.  We will help you convert your data.

Other changes:
* 5g, 6g, 8g: generate code for string index instead of calling function.
* 5l, 6l, 8l: introduce sub-symbols.
* 6l/8l: global and local variables and type info.
* Make.inc: delete unnecessary -fno-inline flag to quietgcc.
* arm: precise float64 software floating point, bug fixes.
* big: arm assembly, faster software mulWW, divWW.
* build: only print "You need to add foo to PATH" when needed.
* container/list: fix Remove bug and use pointer to self as identifier.
* doc: show page title in browser title bar,
        update roadmap.
* encoding/binary: give LittleEndian, BigEndian specific types.
* go/parser: consume auto-inserted semi when calling ParseExpr().
* gobuilder: pass GOHOSTOS and GOHOSTARCH to build,
        write build and benchmarking logs to disk.
* goinstall: display helpful message when encountering a cgo package,
        fix test for multiple package names (thanks Fazlul Shahriar).
* gotest: generate correct gofmt-formatted _testmain.go.
* image/png: speed up paletted encoding ~25% (thanks Brad Fitzpatrick).

<h3 id="2010-10-20">2010-10-20</h3>

<pre>
This release removes the log package's deprecated functions.
Code that has not been updated to use the new interface will break.
See the previous release notes for details:
	http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#2010-10-13

Also included are major improvements to the linker. It is now faster, 
uses less memory, and more parallelizable (but not yet parallel).

The nntp package has been removed from the standard library.
Its new home is the nntp-go project at Google Code:
	http://code.google.com/p/nntp-go
You can install it with goinstall:
	goinstall nntp-go.googlecode.com/hg/nntp
And import it in your code like so:
	import "nntp-go.googlecode.com/hg/nntp"

<h3 id="2010-10-13">2010-10-13</h3>

<pre>
This release includes changes to the log package, the removal of exp/iterable,
two new tools (gotry and goplay), one small language change, and many other
changes and fixes.  If you use the log or iterable packages, you need to make
changes to your code.

The log package has changed.  Loggers now have only one output, and output to
standard error by default.  The names have also changed, although the old names
are still supported.  They will be deleted in the next release, though, so it
would be good to update now if you can.  For most purposes all you need to do
is make these substitutions:
        log.Stderr -> log.Println or log.Print
        log.Stderrf -> log.Printf
        log.Crash -> log.Panicln or log.Panic
        log.Crashf -> log.Panicf
        log.Exit -> log.Exitln or log.Exit
        log.Exitf -> log.Exitf (no change)
Calls to log.New() must drop the second argument.
Also, custom loggers with exit or panic properties will need to be reworked.
For full details, see the change description:
        http://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=d8a3c7563d

The language change is that uses of pointers to interface values no longer
automatically dereference the pointer.  A pointer to an interface value is more
often a beginner’s bug than correct code.

The package exp/iterable has been removed. It was an interesting experiment,
but it encourages writing inefficient code and has outlived its utility.

The new tools:
* gotry: an exercise in reflection and an unusual tool. Run 'gotry' for details.
* goplay: a stand-alone version of the Go Playground. See misc/goplay.

Other changes:
* 6l: Mach-O fixes, and fix to work with OS X nm/otool (thanks Jim McGrath).
* [568]a: correct line numbers for statements.
* arm: code generation and runtime fixes,
	adjust recover for new reflect.call,
	enable 6 more tests after net fix.
* big: fix panic and round correctly in Rat.FloatString (thanks Anthony Martin).
* build: Make.cmd: remove $(OFILES) (thanks Eric Clark),
        Make.pkg: remove .so before installing new one,
        add GOHOSTOS and GOHOSTARCH environment variables.
* crypto/tls: better error messages for certificate issues,
        make SetReadTimeout work.
* doc: add Sydney University video,
	add The Expressiveness of Go talk.
* exp/draw/x11: support X11 vendors other than "The X.Org Foundation".
* expvar: add (*Int).Set (thanks Sam Thorogood).
* fmt: add Errorf helper function,
        allow %d on []byte.
* gc: O(1) string comparison when lengths differ,
        various bug fixes.
* http: return the correct error if a header line is too long.
* image: add image.Tiled type, the Go equivalent of Plan 9's repl bit.
* ld: be less picky about bad line number info.
* misc/cgo/life: fix for new slice rules (thanks Graham Miller).
* net: allow _ in DNS names.
* netchan: export before import when testing, and
        zero out request to ensure correct gob decoding. (thanks Roger Peppe).
* os: make tests work on windows (thanks Alex Brainman).
* runtime: bug fix: serialize mcache allocation,
        correct iteration of large map values,
        faster strequal, memequal (thanks Graham Miller),
        fix argument dump in traceback,
        fix tiny build.
* smtp: new package (thanks Evan Shaw).
* syscall: add sockaddr_ll support for linux/386, linux/amd64 (thanks Mikio Hara),
        add ucred structure for SCM_CREDENTIALS over UNIX sockets. (thanks Albert Strasheim).
* syscall: implement WaitStatus and Wait4() for windows (thanks Wei Guangjing).
* time: add After.
* websocket: enable tests on windows (thanks Alex Brainman).

<h3 id="2010-09-29">2010-09-29</h3>

<pre>
This release includes some minor language changes and some significant package
changes. You may need to change your code if you use ...T parameters or the
http package.

The semantics and syntax of forwarding ...T parameters have changed.
        func message(f string, s ...interface{}) { fmt.Printf(f, s) }
Here, s has type []interface{} and contains the parameters passed to message.
Before this language change, the compiler recognized when a function call
passed a ... parameter to another ... parameter of the same type, and just
passed it as though it was a list of arguments.  But this meant that you
couldn't control whether to pass the slice as a single argument and you
couldn't pass a regular slice as a ... parameter, which can be handy.  This
change gives you that control at the cost of a few characters in the call.
If you want the promotion to ...,  append ... to the argument:
        func message(f string, s ...interface{}) { fmt.Printf(f, s...) }
Without the ..., s would be passed to Printf as a single argument of type
[]interface{}.  The bad news is you might need to fix up some of your code, 
but the compiler will detect the situation and warn you.

Also, the http.Handler and http.HandlerFunc types have changed. Where http
handler functions previously accepted an *http.Conn, they now take an interface
type http.ResponseWriter. ResponseWriter implements the same methods as *Conn,
so in most cases the only change required will be changing the type signature
of your handler function's first parameter. See:
  http://golang.org/pkg/http/#Handler

The utf8 package has a new type, String, that provides efficient indexing 
into utf8 strings by rune (previously an expensive conversion to []int 
was required). See:
  http://golang.org/pkg/utf8/#String

The compiler will now automatically insert a semicolon at the end of a file if
one is not found. This effect of this is that Go source files are no longer
required to have a trailing newline.

Other changes:
* 6prof: more accurate usage message.
* archive/zip: new package for reading Zip files.
* arm: fix code generation, 10 more package tests pass.
* asn1: make interface consistent with json.
* bufio.UnreadRune: fix bug at EOF.

        silence warnings generated by ubuntu gcc,
        use full path when compiling libraries.

* doc: add to and consolidate non-english doc references,
        consolidate FAQs into a single file, go_faq.html,
        updates for new http interface.
* fmt/Printf: document and tweak error messages produced for bad formats.
* gc: allow select case expr = <-c,
        eliminate duplicates in method table,
        fix reflect table method receiver,
        improve error message for x \= 0.

* net: enable v4-over-v6 on ip sockets,
        fix crash in DialIP.
* os: check for valid arguments in windows Readdir (thanks Peter Mundy).

        correct stats in SysFree,
        fix unwindstack crash.

        add inotify on Linux (thanks Balazs Lecz),
        fix socketpair in syscall_bsd,

<h3 id="2010-08-25">2010-08-25</h3>

This release includes changes to the build system that will likely require you
to make changes to your environment variables and Makefiles.

All environment variables are now optional:
 - $GOOS and $GOARCH are now optional; their values should now be inferred 
   automatically by the build system,
 - $GOROOT is now optional, but if you choose not to set it you must run
   'gomake' instead of 'make' or 'gmake' when developing Go programs
   using the conventional Makefiles,
 - $GOBIN remains optional and now defaults to $GOROOT/bin;
   if you wish to use this new default, make sure it is in your $PATH
   and that you have removed the existing binaries from $HOME/bin.

As a result of these changes, the Go Makefiles have changed. If your Makefiles
inherit from the Go Makefiles, you must change this line:
    include ../../Make.$(GOARCH)
to this:
    include ../../Make.inc

This release also removes the deprecated functions in regexp and the 
once package. Any code that still uses them will break.
See the notes from the last release for details:
    http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#2010-08-11

Other changes:
* 6g: better registerization for slices, strings, interface values

<h3 id="2010-08-11">2010-08-11</h3>

<pre>
This release introduces some package changes. You may need to change your
code if you use the once, regexp, image, or exp/draw packages.

The type Once has been added to the sync package. The new sync.Once will
supersede the functionality provided by the once package. We intend to remove
the once package after this release. See:
    http://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Once
All instances of once in the standard library have been replaced with
sync.Once. Reviewing these changes may help you modify your existing code. 
The relevant changeset:
    http://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=fa2c43595119

A new set of methods has been added to the regular expression package, regexp.
These provide a uniformly named approach to discovering the matches of an
expression within a piece of text; see the package documentation for details: 
    http://golang.org/pkg/regexp/
These new methods will, in a later release, replace the old methods for
matching substrings.  The following methods are deprecated:
    Execute (use FindSubmatchIndex)
    ExecuteString (use FindStringSubmatchIndex)
    MatchStrings(use FindStringSubmatch)
    MatchSlices (use FindSubmatch)
    AllMatches (use FindAll; note that n<0 means 'all matches'; was n<=0)
    AllMatchesString (use FindAllString; note that n<0 means 'all matches'; was n<=0)
(Plus there are ten new methods you didn't know you wanted.) 
Please update your code to use the new routines before the next release.

An image.Image now has a Bounds rectangle, where previously it ranged 
from (0, 0) to (Width, Height). Loops that previously looked like:
    for y := 0; y < img.Height(); y++ {
        for x := 0; x < img.Width(); x++ {
            // Do something with img.At(x, y)
        }
    }
should instead be:
    b := img.Bounds()
    for y := b.Min.Y; y < b.Max.Y; y++ {
        for x := b.Min.X; x < b.Max.X; x++ {
            // Do something with img.At(x, y)
        }
    }
The Point and Rectangle types have also moved from exp/draw to image.

Other changes:
* arm: bugfixes and syscall (thanks Kai Backman).
* asn1: fix incorrect encoding of signed integers (thanks Nicholas Waples).
* big: fixes to bitwise functions (thanks Evan Shaw).
* bytes: add IndexRune, FieldsFunc and To*Special (thanks Christian Himpel).

* html: new package, an HTML tokenizer.
* image: change image representation from slice-of-slices to linear buffer,
        introduce Decode and RegisterFormat,
        introduce Transparent and Opaque,
        replace Width and Height by Bounds, add the Point and Rect types.
* libbio: fix Bprint to address 6g issues with large data structures.
* math: fix amd64 Hypot (thanks Charles L. Dorian).
* net/textproto: new package, with example net/dict.
* os: fix ForkExec() handling of envv == nil (thanks Alex Brainman).
* png: grayscale support (thanks Mathieu Lonjaret).
* regexp: document that backslashes are the escape character.
* rpc: catch errors from ReadResponseBody.
* runtime: memory free fix (thanks Alex Brainman).
* template: add ParseFile method to template.Template.
* test/peano: use directly recursive type def.

This release includes a package change. In container/vector, the Iter method
has been removed from the Vector, IntVector, and StringVector types. Also, the

<h3 id="2010-07-01">2010-07-01</h3>

<pre>
This release includes some package changes that may require changes to 
client code.

The Split function in the bytes and strings packages has been changed.
The count argument, which limits the size of the return, previously treated
zero as unbounded. It now treats 0 as 0, and will return an empty slice.  
To request unbounded results, use -1 (or some other negative value).
The new Replace functions in bytes and strings share this behavior.
This may require you change your existing code.

The gob package now allows the transmission of non-struct values at the
top-level. As a result, the rpc and netchan packages have fewer restrictions
on the types they can handle.  For example, netchan can now share a chan int.

The release also includes a Code Walk: "Share Memory By Communicating".
It describes an idiomatic Go program that uses goroutines and channels:
	http://golang.org/doc/codewalk/sharemem/

There is now a Projects page on the Go Dashboard that lists Go programs, 
tools, and libraries:
	http://godashboard.appspot.com/project

Other changes:
* 6a, 6l: bug fixes.
* bytes, strings: add Replace.
* cgo: use slash-free relative paths for .so references.
* cmath: correct IsNaN for argument cmplx(Inf, NaN) (thanks Charles L. Dorian).
* codereview: allow multiple email addresses in CONTRIBUTORS.
* doc/codewalk: add Share Memory By Communicating.
* exp/draw/x11: implement the mapping from keycodes to keysyms.
* fmt: Printf: fix bug in handling of %#v, allow other verbs for slices
        Scan: fix handling of EOFs.
* gc: bug fixes and optimizations.
* gob: add DecodeValue and EncodeValue,
        add support for complex numbers.

This release includes a language change. The "..." function parameter form is
gone; "...T" remains. Typically, "...interface{}" can be used instead of "...".

The implementation of Printf has changed in a way that subtly affects its

code. For details, see:
        https://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/msg/6fffba90a3e3dc06

The reflect package has been changed. If you have code that uses reflect, 
it will need to be updated. For details, see:

This release contains many fixes and improvements, including several
clarifications and consolidations to the Language Specification.

The type checking rules around assignments and conversions are simpler but more
restrictive: assignments no longer convert implicitly from *[10]int to []int
(write x[0:] instead of &x), and conversions can no longer change the names of
types inside composite types.

This release contains three language changes:

1. Accessing a non-existent key in a map is no longer a run-time error.  
It now evaluates to the zero value for that type.  For example:
        x := myMap[i]   is now equivalent to:   x, _ := myMap[i]

2. It is now legal to take the address of a function's return value.  
The return values are copied back to the caller only after deferred
functions have run.

3. The functions panic and recover, intended for reporting and recovering from
failure, have been added to the spec:
	http://golang.org/doc/go_spec.html#Handling_panics 
In a related change, panicln is gone, and panic is now a single-argument
function.  Panic and recover are recognized by the gc compilers but the new
behavior is not yet implemented.

The ARM build is broken in this release; ARM users should stay at release.2010-03-22.

Other changes:
* bytes, strings: add IndexAny.
* cc/ld: Add support for #pragma dynexport,
        Rename dynld to dynimport throughout. Cgo users will need to rerun cgo.

There is one language change: the ability to convert a string to []byte or 
[]int.  This deprecates the strings.Bytes and strings.Runes functions.
You can convert your existing sources using these gofmt commands:
	gofmt -r 'strings.Bytes(x) -> []byte(x)' -w file-or-directory-list
	gofmt -r 'strings.Runes(x) -> []int(x)' -w file-or-directory-list
After running these you might need to delete unused imports of the "strings" 
package.

* 6l/8l/5l: add -r option
* 8g: make a[byte(x)] truncate x
* codereview.py: fix for compatibility with hg >=1.4.3

There are two small language changes: the meaning of chan <- chan int
is now defined, and functions returning functions do not need to 
parenthesize the result type.

There is one significant implementation change: the compilers can
handle multiple packages using the same name in a single binary.
In the gc compilers, this comes at the cost of ensuring that you
always import a particular package using a consistent import path.
In the gccgo compiler, the cost is that you must use the -fgo-prefix
flag to pass a unique prefix (like the eventual import path).

Since the last release there has been one large syntactic change to
the language, already discussed extensively on this list: semicolons
are now implied between statement-ending tokens and newline characters.
See http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/t/5ee32b588d10f2e9 for
details.

By default, gofmt now parses and prints the new lighter weight syntax.
To convert programs written in the old syntax, you can use:

	gofmt -oldparser -w *.go

Since everything was being reformatted anyway, we took the opportunity to
change the way gofmt does alignment.  Now gofmt uses tabs at the start
of a line for basic code alignment, but it uses spaces for alignment of
interior columns.  Thus, in an editor with a fixed-width font, you can
choose your own tab size to change the indentation, and no matter what
tab size you choose, columns will be aligned properly.


In addition to the syntax and formatting changes, there have been many
smaller fixes and updates:

6g,8g,5g: many bug fixes, better registerization,
   build process fix involving mkbuiltin (thanks Yongjian Xu),
   method expressions for concrete types

Since the last release there are two changes to the language: 

* new builtin copy(dst, src) copies n = min(len(dst), len(src)) 
  elements to dst from src and returns n.  It works correctly 
  even if dst and src overlap.  bytes.Copy is gone. 
  Convert your programs using: 
      gofmt -w -r 'bytes.Copy(d, s) -&gt; copy(d, s)' *.go 

* new syntax x[lo:] is shorthand for x[lo:len(x)]. 
  Convert your programs using: 
      gofmt -w -r 'a[b:len(a)] -&gt; a[b:]' *.go 

In addition, there have been many smaller fixes and updates: 

* 6g/8g/5g: many bug fixes

    FreeBSD support (thanks Devon O'Dell) 
* big: much faster on 386. 
* bytes: new function IndexByte, implemented in assembly 
    new function Runes (thanks Peter Froehlich), 
    performance tuning in bytes.Buffer. 
* codereview: various bugs fixed 
* container/vector: New is gone; just declare a Vector instead.
