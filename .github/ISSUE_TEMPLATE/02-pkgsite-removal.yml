      description: |
        We can remove packages with a shared path prefix.
        For example, a request for 'github.com/author' would remove all pkg.go.dev pages with that package path prefix.

        Only the package owners can request to have their packages removed from pkg.go.dev.
        If the package path doesn't include your github username, please provide some other form of proof of ownership.

      description: |
        Requesting we remove a module here only hides the generated documentation on pkg.go.dev.
        It does not affect the behaviour of proxy.golang.org or the go command.
        Instead we recommend using the retract directive which will be processed by all 3 of the above.

        If you have deleted your repo, please recreate it and publish a retraction.

        Retracting a module version involves adding a retract directive to your go.mod file and publishing a new version.
        For example: https://github.com/jba/retract-demo/blob/main/go.mod#L5-L8.
        See https://pkg.go.dev/about#removing-a-package for additional tips on retractions.
