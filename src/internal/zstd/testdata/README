This directory holds files for testing zstd.NewReader.

Each one is a Zstandard compressed file named as hash.arbitrary-name.zst,
where hash is the first eight hexadecimal digits of the SHA256 hash
of the expected uncompressed content:

	zstd -d < 1890a371.gettysburg.txt-100x.zst | sha256sum | head -c 8
	1890a371

The test uses hash value to verify decompression result.
