// Tests a G being created from within a syscall.
//
// Specifically, it tests a scenario wherein a C
// thread is calling into Go, creating a goroutine in
// a syscall (in the tracer's model). The system is free
// to reuse thread IDs, so first a thread ID is used to
// call into Go, and then is used for a Go-created thread.
//
// This is a regression test. The trace parser didn't correctly
// model GoDestroySyscall as dropping its P (even if the runtime
// did). It turns out this is actually fine if all the threads
// in the trace have unique IDs, since the P just stays associated
// with an eternally dead thread, and it's stolen by some other
// thread later. But if thread IDs are reused, then the tracer
// gets confused when trying to advance events on the new thread.
// The now-dead thread which exited on a GoDestroySyscall still has
// its P associated and this transfers to the newly-live thread
// in the parser's state because they share a thread ID.
