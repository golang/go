testfp.txt contains conversion tests from Vern Paxson's paper
“A Program for Testing IEEE Decimal-Binary Conversion”
https://www.icir.org/vern/papers/testbase-report.pdf

That paper from 1991 describes a tester called 'testbase',
written in non-64-bit-safe pre-ANSI C.
As of 2025, it is still available at ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/testbase.tar.Z.

The files

	https://swtch.com/testbase/atof.txt
	https://swtch.com/testbase/ftoa.txt

are the test inputs that testbase generates and checks,
logged during an actual run, totaling about 10 MB.

The files atof1k.txt and ftoa1k.txt in this directory each contain
1000 random samples of the full trace. They are used during
'go test internal/strconv'.

Running 'go test internal/strconv -testbase' downloads the
complete files into this directory as atof.txt and ftoa.txt and
then uses those instead of the sampled versions.
The complete tests take about 10 seconds on a Macbook Pro.

Backup copies of the files are also posted at
https://gist.github.com/rsc/606b378b0bf95c24a6fd6cef99e262e1.
