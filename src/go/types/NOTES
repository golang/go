This file works as a sort of notebook/implementation log. It replaces my notebook-based approach
so we have a better track record. I only switched to this file in Nov 2019, hence it is incomplete.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO

- revisit uses of (raw)lookupFieldOrMethod with respect to the addressable flag (can we get rid of it?)
- revisit all uses of derefUnpack in lookup.go (see local comments); create test cases
- review use of Contract.TParams field - it seems like it's only needed for length checks?
- review handling of fields of instantiated generic types (do we need to make them non-parameterized,
  similar to what we did for the embedded interfaces created by contract embedding?)
- improve error messages!
- use []*TypeParam for tparams in subst? (unclear)
- should we use nil instead of &emptyInterface for no type bounds (as an optimization)?
- TBD: in prose, should we use "generic" or "parameterized" (try to be consistent)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN ISSUES

- iteration over generic variables doesn't report certain channel errors (see TODOs in code)
- cannot handle mutually recursive parameterized interfaces using themselves as type bounds
- contract instantiation requires the type arguments to be type parameters from the type of function
  type parameter list or enclosing contract
- A type parameter that is constrained by multiple contracts will not get the correct type bound.
  We may disallow this for  now.
- Type-checking for type parameters with pointer designation in contracts is not implemented.
  Do we actually need it? (Should the draft be updated?)
- If we do need type-checking for type parameters with pointer designation in contracts, figure
  out how to model this with interfaces. Do we need two interfaces, one for a T and one for a *T?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OBSERVATIONS

- 2/20/2020: Because we permit parenthesized types anywhere for consistency, also in parameter lists (mea
  culpa), we have parsing ambiguities when using instantiated types in parameter lists w/o argument names.
  We could disallow the use of parentheses at the top level of type literals and then we might not have
  this problem. This is not a backward-compatible change but perhaps worthwhile investigating. Specifically,
  will this always work (look specifically at channel types where we need parentheses for disambiguation
  and possibly function types). File a proposal?

- 2/21/2020: We do need top-level parentheses around types in certain situations such as conversions
  or composite literals. We could disallow parentheses around types in parameter lists only, but that
  seems quite a bit less elegant.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPEN QUESTIONS

- Parsing _ = [](a(int)){} requires parentheses around `(a(int))` - should the parser be smarter in
  these cases? Another example: []a(b, c){} This cannot be a conversion. Could fix such cases by re-
  associating the AST when we see a {. Need to be careful, and need to take into account additional
  complexity of spec.
- What is the exact nature of a generic type? Does it act as a named type (it can have methods)?
- For len/cap(x) where x is of type parameter type and the bound contains arrays only, should the
  result be a constant? (right now it is not). What are the implications for alternative, non-
  monomorphizing implementation methods?
- Confirm that it's ok to use inference in missingMethod to compare parameterized methods.
- What does it mean to explicitly instantiate a contract with a non-type parameter argument?
  (e.g., contract C(T) { T int }; func _(type T C(int))(...) ... seems invalid. What are the rules?)
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESIGN/IMPLEMENTATION

- 11/19/2019: For type parameters with interface bounds to work, the scope of all type parameters in
  a type parameter list starts at the "type" keyword. This makes all type parameters visible for all
  type parameter bounds (interfaces that may be parameterized with the type parameters).

- 12/4/2019: do not allow parenthesized generic uninstantiated types (unless instantiated implicitly)
  In other words: generic types must always be instantiated before they can be used in any form
  More generally: Only permit type instantiation T(x) in type context, when the type is a named type.
  Do not permit it in general in type context: e.g., disallow []T(x) because we consider that a
  conversion, in general. Same for ([]T)(x).

- 12/12/2019: represent type bounds always as (possibly unnamed) interfaces
  (contracts are user syntactic sugar)

- 12/19/2019: Type parameters don't act like type aliases. For instance:

        func f(type T1, T2)(x T1) T2 { return x }

  is not valid, no matter how T1 and T2 are instantiated (but if T1 and T2 were type aliases with
  both of them having type int, the return x would be valid). In fact, the type parameters act more
  like named types with the methods described by their type bound. But type parameters are never
  interfaces. To determine: Given a type parameter P, is P == underlying(P) (like for basic types),
  or is the the underlying type of P something else (like for defined types). Is there an observable
  difference?

- 12/19/2019: Rewrote contract handling: they are now treated as Objects (rather than Types) throughout.

- 12/20/2019: Decided to start moving type parameters to types (from TypeName to Named), need to do the
  same for Func. This make more sense as in general any type (conceptually even literal types) could
  have type parameters. It's a property of the type, not the type name. It also simplified the code.

- 12/20/2019: Type parameters may be part of type lists in contracts/interfaces. It just falls out
  naturally. Added test cases.

- 12/23/2019: Decision: Type parameters and ordinary (value) parameters are in the same block, notably
  the function block. The scope of type parameters starts at the 'type' keyword; the scope of ordinary
  parameters starts with the (opening '{' of the) function body. Both scopes end with the closing '}'
  of the function body (i.e., the end of the function block).

- 1/2/2020: Implementation decision: contracts can only be declared at the package level.

- 1/6/2020: Experimental: First steps towards permitting type parameters in methods as a generalization.
  Type-checking problems ooccurring from this are likely to highlight general problematic areas.
  First consequence: Scope of type parameters starts at "func" keyword which means that receiver type
  name cannot be a type parameter name declared later (or by the receiver type specification). This
  seems reasonable and should help avoid confusion which is possible otherwise.

- 1/7/2020: We distinguish embedded instantiated (parameterized) interfaces from methods by enclosing
  the embedded interfaces in parentheses (the design draft recommends this change). Since this opens
  the possibility for any parenthesized type (that is an interface), we can also allow (parenthesized)
  interface literals as it is simpler to permit those than forbid them.

- 1/7/2020: The current implementation permits empty type parameter lists as in: "func f(type)(x int)"
  but we cannot call such a function as "f()(1)"; the empty type argument list causes problems.
  Document that we allow empty type parameter list declarations, but not empty actual type parameter
  lists. (We could allow them for types, but that doesn't seem consistent and probably is confusing).

- 2/19/2020: We accept parenthesized embedded struct fields so we can distinguish between a named
  field with a parenthesized type foo (T) and an embedded parameterized type (foo(T)), similarly
  to interace embedding.

- 2/19/2020: Permit parentheses around embedded contracts for symmetry with embedding in structs
  and interfaces.

- 2/20/2020: Receiver type parameters must always be provided in the receiver parameter list of
  a method, even if they are not used by the method. Since the receiver acts like an implicit
  declaration of those type parameters, they may be blank, as with any other declaration.

- 3/20/2020: Local type declarations with an underlying type that is a type parameter lose the
  methods declared with the type parameter bound. But they don't lose the properties of the
  underlying type, i.e., the properties of the type parameter bound's type list.
  This is something to consider if we were contemplating moving to a methods-only approach
  (no type lists), even though local type declarations are exceedingly rare if they exist at
  all in the wild.

- 3/24/2020: Implemented initial support for bidirection type unification which could make
  type inference more powerful if we decided to go that route. Specifically, this would
  permit type inference for the type parameters of a generic function argument. Given:
  func h(f func(int)); func g(type T)(T); one could allow the call: h(g) and the type argument
  T of g would be inferred to be int. While not hard to implement, this would be a special case
  of the rule that all generic types/functions must be instantiated before they are used except
  for function calls where the type arguments can be inferred from the actual arguments.
  Decided that for now we leave things as is, since it's not clear the extra complexity is
  worth the (probably small) convenience.

- 3/25/2020: We can probably simplify the contract syntax again and only permit one of three
  possible constraint entries: 1) an embedded contract, 2) a type parameter followed by a
  method signature, and 3) a type parameter followed by a type list. This is what the type
  checker currently supports and the printer can print. (The parser still accepts a list of
  method signatures or types, freely mixed.)
