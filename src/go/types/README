go/*: GopherCon 2019 snapshot of go/* packages supporting contracts

DO NOT REVIEW. DO NOT SUBMIT.

This code contains changes to go/types and the go/* support libraries
to type-check generic code as outlined in the latest contracts proposal
and presented by Ian Lance Taylor at GopherCon 2019 in San Diego.

CAUTION: PROTOTYPE. THERE ARE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN BUGS.

Read and use this code at your own risk.

STATUS

Most aspects of the contracts proposal have been implemented and tested
(but expect bugs). go/types can now type-check all the *.go2 test
files in the testdata and examples directories.

ALTERNATIVE NOTATION

To experiment with an alternative notation to contracts, this
implementation permits the use of (possibly parameterized)
interfaces instead of a contract. Specifically, the following
notations are permitted and equivalent:

// Instead of a contract

contract C(P1, P2) {
        P1 m1(x P1)
        P2 m2(x P1) P2
        P2 int, float64
}

// used in a generic function

func f (type P1, P2 C) (x P1, y P2) P2

// one may use a pair of parameterized interfaces I1 and I2
// describing the bounds (constraints) of the respective type
// parameters P1 and P2:

type I1(type P1) interface {
        m1(x P1)
}

type I2(type P1, P2) interface {
        m2(x P1) P2
        type int, float64
}

The function f above can then be written:

func f(type P1 I1(P1), P2 I2(P1, P2)) (x P1, y P2) P2

Obviously, the interface notation is longer in general, but it
doesn't require a fundamentally new mechanism (but for the ability
to enumerate a list of types). In many (most?) cases, the interfaces
may not need to be parameterized at all, in which case the typing
overhead is not as big. Using interfaces as constraints also opens
the door to using already existing interfaces (such as io.Reader)
directly.

Internally, the type checker disassembles a contract into its
component interfaces, one for each type parameter, each possibly
parameterized by the type parameters of the contract. Allowing to
use interfaces directly instead of contracts leads to a simpler
implementation. In other words, the contract notation is simply
a form of syntactic sugar for type parameter bounds expressed as
interfaces. This approach also removes the conflict between contracts
and interfaces and the question if they can be mixed and how.
Interfaces are the fundamental underlying typing mechanism;
contracts are syntactic sugar that may improve readability.

To explore the boundaries of this new approach, this prototype
permits type parameters also on methods (we don't have a good
idea how to implement that but we can easily type-check it).

MAJOR KNOWN ISSUES

- Various type-specific operations (such as sending a message, type
  assertions, etc.) on expressions of a generic type don't work yet
  (but are relatively easy to implement going forward)
- Error messages are reasonable but expect them to be significantly
  better in a real implementation.
- Type parameters with pointer designation in contracts are not yet
  supported (e.g.: contract C(T) { *T m() } ).

current state and issues.

TO PLAY WITH THIS PROTOTYPE

- Cherry-pick this CL on top of tip (the cherry-pick was tested with
  tip at 48a90d639d):

  git fetch "https://go.googlesource.com/go" ... && git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD

  (replace the ... with the respective information from Gerrit's CL page)

- In the go/types directory, verify that the tests run:

  go test

  (If this causes a vet error, run "go test -vet off" instead.)

  Note: This version of go/types is built in "debug" mode (see check.go:17)
  and does extra checks. As a consequence it may run a bit slower than usual.

- In the go/types directory, build the gotype command:

  go build gotype.go

- Run it against a test case (from the go/types directory):

  ./gotype examples/functions.go2

- Alternatively, use the go/types test framework to get detailed type-checking
  information. For instance:

   go test -run Check$ -files testdata/contracts.go2 -v

  (the -v option provides a type-checking trace)

See also `gotype -h` for more information.

Note: Currently, files containing parameterized code have extension ".go2".
This is solely to distinguish them from regular Go code and to prevent gofmt
from touching them. We expect a proper implementation to keep using ".go".
