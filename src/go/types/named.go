// Type-checking Named types is subtle, because they may be recursively
// defined, and because their full details may be spread across multiple
// declarations (via methods). For this reason they are type-checked lazily,
// to avoid information being accessed before it is complete.
//
// Conceptually, it is helpful to think of named types as having two distinct
// sets of information:
//  - "LHS" information, defining their identity: Obj() and TypeArgs()
//  - "RHS" information, defining their details: TypeParams(), Underlying(),
//    and methods.
//
// In this taxonomy, LHS information is available immediately, but RHS
// information is lazy. Specifically, a named type N may be constructed in any
// of the following ways:
//  1. type-checked from the source
//  2. loaded eagerly from export data
//  3. loaded lazily from export data (when using unified IR)
//  4. instantiated from a generic type
//
// In cases 1, 3, and 4, it is possible that the underlying type or methods of
// N may not be immediately available.
//  - During type-checking, we allocate N before type-checking its underlying
//    type or methods, so that we may resolve recursive references.
//  - When loading from export data, we may load its methods and underlying
//    type lazily using a provided load function.
//  - After instantiating, we lazily expand the underlying type and methods
//    (note that instances may be created while still in the process of
//    type-checking the original type declaration).
//
// In cases 3 and 4 this lazy construction may also occur concurrently, due to
// concurrent use of the type checker API (after type checking or importing has
// finished). It is critical that we keep track of state, so that Named types
// are constructed exactly once and so that we do not access their details too
// soon.
//
// We achieve this by tracking state with an atomic state variable, and
// guarding potentially concurrent calculations with a mutex. At any point in
// time this state variable determines which data on N may be accessed. As
// state monotonically progresses, any data available at state M may be
// accessed without acquiring the mutex at state N, provided N >= M.
//
// GLOSSARY: Here are a few terms used in this file to describe Named types:
//  - We say that a Named type is "instantiated" if it has been constructed by
//    instantiating a generic named type with type arguments.
//  - We say that a Named type is "declared" if it corresponds to a type
//    declaration in the source. Instantiated named types correspond to a type
//    instantiation in the source, not a declaration. But their Origin type is
//    a declared type.
//  - We say that a Named type is "resolved" if its RHS information has been
//    loaded or fully type-checked. For Named types constructed from export
//    data, this may involve invoking a loader function to extract information
//    from export data. For instantiated named types this involves reading
//    information from their origin.
//  - We say that a Named type is "expanded" if it is an instantiated type and
//    type parameters in its underlying type and methods have been substituted
//    with the type arguments from the instantiation. A type may be partially
//    expanded if some but not all of these details have been substituted.
//    Similarly, we refer to these individual details (underlying type or
//    method) as being "expanded".
//  - When all information is known for a named type, we say it is "complete".
//
// Some invariants to keep in mind: each declared Named type has a single
// corresponding object, and that object's type is the (possibly generic) Named
// type. Declared Named types are identical if and only if their pointers are
// identical. On the other hand, multiple instantiated Named types may be
// identical even though their pointers are not identical. One has to use
// Identical to compare them. For instantiated named types, their obj is a
// synthetic placeholder that records their position of the corresponding
// instantiation in the source (if they were constructed during type checking).
//
// To prevent infinite expansion of named instances that are created outside of
// type-checking, instances share a Context with other instances created during
// their expansion. Via the pidgeonhole principle, this guarantees that in the
// presence of a cycle of named types, expansion will eventually find an
// existing instance in the Context and short-circuit the expansion.
//
// Once an instance is complete, we can nil out this shared Context to unpin
// memory, though this Context may still be held by other incomplete instances
// in its "lineage".
