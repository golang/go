// Type-checking Named types is subtle, because they may be recursively
// defined, and because their full details may be spread across multiple
// declarations (via methods). For this reason they are type-checked lazily,
// to avoid information being accessed before it is complete.
//
// Conceptually, it is helpful to think of named types as having two distinct
// sets of information:
//  - "LHS" information, defining their identity: Obj() and TypeArgs()
//  - "RHS" information, defining their details: TypeParams(), Underlying(),
//    and methods.
//
// In this taxonomy, LHS information is available immediately, but RHS
// information is lazy. Specifically, a named type N may be constructed in any
// of the following ways:
//  1. type-checked from the source
//  2. loaded eagerly from export data
//  3. loaded lazily from export data (when using unified IR)
//  4. instantiated from a generic type
//
// In cases 1, 3, and 4, it is possible that the underlying type or methods of
// N may not be immediately available.
//  - During type-checking, we allocate N before type-checking its underlying
//    type or methods, so that we can create recursive references.
//  - When loading from export data, we may load its methods and underlying
//    type lazily using a provided load function.
//  - After instantiating, we lazily expand the underlying type and methods
//    (note that instances may be created while still in the process of
//    type-checking the original type declaration).
//
// In cases 3 and 4 this lazy construction may also occur concurrently, due to
// concurrent use of the type checker API (after type checking or importing has
// finished). It is critical that we keep track of state, so that Named types
// are constructed exactly once and so that we do not access their details too
// soon.
//
// We achieve this by tracking state with an atomic state variable, and
// guarding potentially concurrent calculations with a mutex. See [stateMask]
// for details.
//
// GLOSSARY: Here are a few terms used in this file to describe Named types:
//  - We say that a Named type is "instantiated" if it has been constructed by
//    instantiating a generic named type with type arguments.
//  - We say that a Named type is "declared" if it corresponds to a type
//    declaration in the source. Instantiated named types correspond to a type
//    instantiation in the source, not a declaration. But their Origin type is
//    a declared type.
//  - We say that a Named type is "unpacked" if its RHS information has been
//    populated, normalizing its representation for use in type-checking
//    operations and abstracting away how it was created:
//      - For a Named type constructed from unified IR, this involves invoking
//        a lazy loader function to extract details from UIR as needed.
//      - For an instantiated Named type, this involves extracting information
//        from its origin and substituting type arguments into a "synthetic"
//        RHS; this process is called "expanding" the RHS (see below).
//  - We say that a Named type is "expanded" if it is an instantiated type and
//    type parameters in its RHS and methods have been substituted with the type
//    arguments from the instantiation. A type may be partially expanded if some
//    but not all of these details have been substituted. Similarly, we refer to
//    these individual details (RHS or method) as being "expanded".
//
// Some invariants to keep in mind: each declared Named type has a single
// corresponding object, and that object's type is the (possibly generic) Named
// type. Declared Named types are identical if and only if their pointers are
// identical. On the other hand, multiple instantiated Named types may be
// identical even though their pointers are not identical. One has to use
// Identical to compare them. For instantiated named types, their obj is a
// synthetic placeholder that records their position of the corresponding
// instantiation in the source (if they were constructed during type checking).
//
// To prevent infinite expansion of named instances that are created outside of
// type-checking, instances share a Context with other instances created during
// their expansion. Via the pidgeonhole principle, this guarantees that in the
// presence of a cycle of named types, expansion will eventually find an
// existing instance in the Context and short-circuit the expansion.
//
// Once an instance is fully expanded, we can nil out this shared Context to unpin
// memory, though the Context may still be held by other incomplete instances
// in its "lineage".

// A Named represents a named (defined) type.
//
// A declaration such as:
//
//	type S struct { ... }
//
// creates a defined type whose underlying type is a struct,
// and binds this type to the object S, a [TypeName].
// Use [Named.Underlying] to access the underlying type.
// Use [Named.Obj] to obtain the object S.
//
// Before type aliases (Go 1.9), the spec called defined types "named types".

// stateMask represents each state in the lifecycle of a named type.
//
// Each named type begins in the initial state. A named type may transition to a new state
// according to the below diagram:
//
//	initial
//	lazyLoaded
//	unpacked
//	└── hasMethods
//	└── hasUnder
//
// That is, descent down the tree is mostly linear (initial through unpacked), except upon
// reaching the leaves (hasMethods and hasUnder). A type may occupy any combination of the
// leaf states at once (they are independent states).
//
// To represent this independence, the set of active states is represented with a bit set. State
// transitions are monotonic. Once a state bit is set, it remains set.
//
// The above constraints significantly narrow the possible bit sets for a named type. With bits
// set left-to-right, they are:
//
//	0000 | initial
//	1000 | lazyLoaded
//	1100 | unpacked, which implies lazyLoaded
//	1110 | hasMethods, which implies unpacked (which in turn implies lazyLoaded)
//	1101 | hasUnder, which implies unpacked ...
//	1111 | both hasMethods and hasUnder which implies unpacked ...
//
// To read the state of a named type, use [Named.stateHas]; to write, use [Named.setState].
