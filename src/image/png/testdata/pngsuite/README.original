Permission to use, copy, and distribute these images for any purpose and
without fee is hereby granted.

These 15 images are part of the much larger PngSuite test-set of 
images, available for developers of PNG supporting software. The 
complete set, available at http:/www.schaik.com/pngsuite/, contains 
a variety of images to test interlacing, gamma settings, ancillary
chunks, etc.

The images in this directory represent the basic PNG color-types:
grayscale (1-16 bit deep), full color (8 or 16 bit), paletted
(1-8 bit) and grayscale or color images with alpha channel. You
can use them to test the proper functioning of PNG software.
