# See golang.org/s/go15bootstrap for an overview of the build process.

# Environment variables that control make.rc:
#
# GOROOT_FINAL: The expected final Go root, baked into binaries.
# The default is the location of the Go tree during the build.
#
# GOHOSTARCH: The architecture for host tools (compilers and
# binaries).  Binaries of this type must be executable on the current
# system, so the only common reason to set this is to set
# GOHOSTARCH=386 on an amd64 machine.
#
# GOARCH: The target architecture for installed packages and tools.
#
# GOOS: The target operating system for installed packages and tools.
#
# GO_GCFLAGS: Additional 5g/6g/8g arguments to use when
# building the packages and commands.
#
# GO_LDFLAGS: Additional 5l/6l/8l arguments to use when
# building the commands.
#
# GO_CCFLAGS: Additional 5c/6c/8c arguments to use when
# building.
#
# CGO_ENABLED: Controls cgo usage during the build. Set it to 1
# to include all cgo related files, .c and .go file with "cgo"
# build directive, in the build. Set it to 0 to ignore them.
