		# 8l rewrites 0(GS) and 4(GS) into these.

		# register and then use -8(%reg) and -4(%reg).  This kind
		# of addressing is correct even when not running Xen.
		#
		# 8l can rewrite MOVL 0(GS), CX into the appropriate pair
		# of mov instructions, using CX as the intermediate register
		# (safe because CX is about to be written to anyway).
		# But 8l cannot handle other instructions, like storing into 0(GS),
		# which is where these macros come into play.
		# get_tls sets up the temporary and then g and r use it.

		# The final wrinkle is that get_tls needs to read from %gs:0,

		# subtract 8 from all the offsets, as described above.
