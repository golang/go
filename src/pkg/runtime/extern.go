Package runtime contains operations that interact with Go's runtime system,
such as functions to control goroutines. It also includes the low-level type information
used by the reflect package; see reflect's documentation for the programmable
interface to the run-time type system.

Environment Variables

The following environment variables ($name or %name%, depending on the host
operating system) control the run-time behavior of Go programs. The meanings
and use may change from release to release.

The GOGC variable sets the initial garbage collection target percentage.
A collection is triggered when the ratio of freshly allocated data to live data
remaining after the previous collection reaches this percentage. The default
is GOGC=100. Setting GOGC=off disables the garbage collector entirely.
The runtime/debug package's SetGCPercent function allows changing this
percentage at run time. See http://golang.org/pkg/runtime/debug/#SetGCPercent.

The GODEBUG variable controls debug output from the runtime. GODEBUG value is
a comma-separated list of name=val pairs. Supported names are:

	allocfreetrace: setting allocfreetrace=1 causes every allocation to be
	profiled and a stack trace printed on each object's allocation and free.

	efence: setting efence=1 causes the allocator to run in a mode
	where each object is allocated on a unique page and addresses are
	never recycled.

	gctrace: setting gctrace=1 causes the garbage collector to emit a single line to standard
	error at each collection, summarizing the amount of memory collected and the
	length of the pause. Setting gctrace=2 emits the same summary but also
	repeats each collection.

	gcdead: setting gcdead=1 causes the garbage collector to clobber all stack slots
	that it thinks are dead.

	scheddetail: setting schedtrace=X and scheddetail=1 causes the scheduler to emit
	detailed multiline info every X milliseconds, describing state of the scheduler,
	processors, threads and goroutines.

	schedtrace: setting schedtrace=X causes the scheduler to emit a single line to standard
	error every X milliseconds, summarizing the scheduler state.

The GOMAXPROCS variable limits the number of operating system threads that
can execute user-level Go code simultaneously. There is no limit to the number of threads
that can be blocked in system calls on behalf of Go code; those do not count against
the GOMAXPROCS limit. This package's GOMAXPROCS function queries and changes
the limit.

The GOTRACEBACK variable controls the amount of output generated when a Go
program fails due to an unrecovered panic or an unexpected runtime condition.
By default, a failure prints a stack trace for every extant goroutine, eliding functions
internal to the run-time system, and then exits with exit code 2.
If GOTRACEBACK=0, the per-goroutine stack traces are omitted entirely.
If GOTRACEBACK=1, the default behavior is used.
If GOTRACEBACK=2, the per-goroutine stack traces include run-time functions.
If GOTRACEBACK=crash, the per-goroutine stack traces include run-time functions,
and if possible the program crashes in an operating-specific manner instead of
exiting. For example, on Unix systems, the program raises SIGABRT to trigger a
core dump.

The GOARCH, GOOS, GOPATH, and GOROOT environment variables complete
the set of Go environment variables. They influence the building of Go programs
(see http://golang.org/cmd/go and http://golang.org/pkg/go/build).
GOARCH, GOOS, and GOROOT are recorded at compile time and made available by
constants or functions in this package, but they do not influence the execution
of the run-time system.
