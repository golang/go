//
// If a program has already received a value from t.C, the timer is known
// to have expired and the channel drained, so t.Reset can be used directly.
// If a program has not yet received a value from t.C, however,
// the timer must be stopped and—if Stop reports that the timer expired

// is a race condition between draining the channel and the new timer expiring.
// Reset should always be invoked on stopped or expired channels, as described above.
// The return value exists to preserve compatibility with existing programs.
//
// For a Timer created with AfterFunc(d, f), Reset either reschedules
// when f will run, in which case Reset returns true, or schedules f
// to run again, in which case it returns false.
// When Reset returns false, Reset neither waits for the prior f to
// complete before returning nor does it guarantee that the subsequent
// goroutine running f does not run concurrently with the prior
// one. If the caller needs to know whether the prior execution of
// f is completed, it must coordinate with f explicitly.
