//go:build goexperiment.jsonv2

// Package json implements semantic processing of JSON as specified in RFC 8259.
// JSON is a simple data interchange format that can represent
// primitive data types such as booleans, strings, and numbers,
// in addition to structured data types such as objects and arrays.
//
// This package (encoding/json/v2) is experimental,
// and not subject to the Go 1 compatibility promise.
// It only exists when building with the GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 environment variable set.
// Most users should use [encoding/json].
//
// [Marshal] and [Unmarshal] encode and decode Go values
// to/from JSON text contained within a []byte.
// [MarshalWrite] and [UnmarshalRead] operate on JSON text
// by writing to or reading from an [io.Writer] or [io.Reader].
// [MarshalEncode] and [UnmarshalDecode] operate on JSON text
// by encoding to or decoding from a [jsontext.Encoder] or [jsontext.Decoder].
// [Options] may be passed to each of the marshal or unmarshal functions
// to configure the semantic behavior of marshaling and unmarshaling
// (i.e., alter how JSON data is understood as Go data and vice versa).
// [jsontext.Options] may also be passed to the marshal or unmarshal functions
// to configure the syntactic behavior of encoding or decoding.
//
// The data types of JSON are mapped to/from the data types of Go based on
// the closest logical equivalent between the two type systems. For example,
// a JSON boolean corresponds with a Go bool,
// a JSON string corresponds with a Go string,
// a JSON number corresponds with a Go int, uint or float,
// a JSON array corresponds with a Go slice or array, and
// a JSON object corresponds with a Go struct or map.
// See the documentation on [Marshal] and [Unmarshal] for a comprehensive list
// of how the JSON and Go type systems correspond.
//
// Arbitrary Go types can customize their JSON representation by implementing
// [Marshaler], [MarshalerTo], [Unmarshaler], or [UnmarshalerFrom].
// This provides authors of Go types with control over how their types are
// serialized as JSON. Alternatively, users can implement functions that match
// [MarshalFunc], [MarshalToFunc], [UnmarshalFunc], or [UnmarshalFromFunc]
// to specify the JSON representation for arbitrary types.
// This provides callers of JSON functionality with control over
// how any arbitrary type is serialized as JSON.
//
// # JSON Representation of Go structs
//
// A Go struct is naturally represented as a JSON object,
// where each Go struct field corresponds with a JSON object member.
// When marshaling, all Go struct fields are recursively encoded in depth-first
// order as JSON object members except those that are ignored or omitted.
// When unmarshaling, JSON object members are recursively decoded
// into the corresponding Go struct fields.
// Object members that do not match any struct fields,
// also known as “unknown members”, are ignored by default or rejected
// if [RejectUnknownMembers] is specified.
//
// The representation of each struct field can be customized in the
// "json" struct field tag, where the tag is a comma separated list of options.
// As a special case, if the entire tag is `json:"-"`,
// then the field is ignored with regard to its JSON representation.
// Some options also have equivalent behavior controlled by a caller-specified [Options].
// Field-specified options take precedence over caller-specified options.
//
// The first option is the JSON object name override for the Go struct field.
// If the name is not specified, then the Go struct field name
// is used as the JSON object name. JSON names containing commas or quotes,
// or names identical to "" or "-", can be specified using
// a single-quoted string literal, where the syntax is identical to
// the Go grammar for a double-quoted string literal,
// but instead uses single quotes as the delimiters.
// By default, unmarshaling uses case-sensitive matching to identify
// the Go struct field associated with a JSON object name.
//
// After the name, the following tag options are supported:
//
//   - omitzero: When marshaling, the "omitzero" option specifies that
//     the struct field should be omitted if the field value is zero
//     as determined by the "IsZero() bool" method if present,
//     otherwise based on whether the field is the zero Go value.
//     This option has no effect when unmarshaling.
//
//   - omitempty: When marshaling, the "omitempty" option specifies that
//     the struct field should be omitted if the field value would have been
//     encoded as a JSON null, empty string, empty object, or empty array.
//     This option has no effect when unmarshaling.
//
//   - string: The "string" option specifies that [StringifyNumbers]
//     be set when marshaling or unmarshaling a struct field value.
//     This causes numeric types to be encoded as a JSON number
//     within a JSON string, and to be decoded from a JSON string
//     containing the JSON number without any surrounding whitespace.
//     This extra level of encoding is often necessary since
//     many JSON parsers cannot precisely represent 64-bit integers.
//
//   - case: When unmarshaling, the "case" option specifies how
//     JSON object names are matched with the JSON name for Go struct fields.
//     The option is a key-value pair specified as "case:value" where
//     the value must either be 'ignore' or 'strict'.
//     The 'ignore' value specifies that matching is case-insensitive
//     where dashes and underscores are also ignored. If multiple fields match,
//     the first declared field in breadth-first order takes precedence.
//     The 'strict' value specifies that matching is case-sensitive.
//     This takes precedence over the [MatchCaseInsensitiveNames] option.
//
//   - inline: The "inline" option specifies that
//     the JSON representable content of this field type is to be promoted
//     as if they were specified in the parent struct.
//     It is the JSON equivalent of Go struct embedding.
//     A Go embedded field is implicitly inlined unless an explicit JSON name
//     is specified. The inlined field must be a Go struct
//     (that does not implement any JSON methods), [jsontext.Value],
//     map[~string]T, or an unnamed pointer to such types. When marshaling,
//     inlined fields from a pointer type are omitted if it is nil.
//     Inlined fields of type [jsontext.Value] and map[~string]T are called
//     “inlined fallbacks” as they can represent all possible
//     JSON object members not directly handled by the parent struct.
//     Only one inlined fallback field may be specified in a struct,
//     while many non-fallback fields may be specified. This option
//     must not be specified with any other option (including the JSON name).
//
//   - unknown: The "unknown" option is a specialized variant
//     of the inlined fallback to indicate that this Go struct field
//     contains any number of unknown JSON object members. The field type must
//     be a [jsontext.Value], map[~string]T, or an unnamed pointer to such types.
//     If [DiscardUnknownMembers] is specified when marshaling,
//     the contents of this field are ignored.
//     If [RejectUnknownMembers] is specified when unmarshaling,
//     any unknown object members are rejected regardless of whether
//     an inlined fallback with the "unknown" option exists. This option
//     must not be specified with any other option (including the JSON name).
//
//   - format: The "format" option specifies a format flag
//     used to specialize the formatting of the field value.
//     The option is a key-value pair specified as "format:value" where
//     the value must be either a literal consisting of letters and numbers
//     (e.g., "format:RFC3339") or a single-quoted string literal
//     (e.g., "format:'2006-01-02'"). The interpretation of the format flag
//     is determined by the struct field type.
//
// The "omitzero" and "omitempty" options are mostly semantically identical.
// The former is defined in terms of the Go type system,
// while the latter in terms of the JSON type system.
// Consequently they behave differently in some circumstances.
// For example, only a nil slice or map is omitted under "omitzero", while
// an empty slice or map is omitted under "omitempty" regardless of nilness.
// The "omitzero" option is useful for types with a well-defined zero value
// (e.g., [net/netip.Addr]) or have an IsZero method (e.g., [time.Time.IsZero]).
//
// Every Go struct corresponds to a list of JSON representable fields
// which is constructed by performing a breadth-first search over
// all struct fields (excluding unexported or ignored fields),
// where the search recursively descends into inlined structs.
// The set of non-inlined fields in a struct must have unique JSON names.
// If multiple fields all have the same JSON name, then the one
// at shallowest depth takes precedence and the other fields at deeper depths
// are excluded from the list of JSON representable fields.
// If multiple fields at the shallowest depth have the same JSON name,
// but exactly one is explicitly tagged with a JSON name,
// then that field takes precedence and all others are excluded from the list.
// This is analogous to Go visibility rules for struct field selection
// with embedded struct types.
//
// Marshaling or unmarshaling a non-empty struct
// without any JSON representable fields results in a [SemanticError].
// Unexported fields must not have any `json` tags except for `json:"-"`.
