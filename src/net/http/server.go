	//
	// Changing the header map after a call to [ResponseWriter.WriteHeader] (or
	// [ResponseWriter.Write]) has no effect unless the HTTP status code was of the
	// 1xx class or the modified headers are trailers.
	//
	// There are two ways to set Trailers. The preferred way is to
	// predeclare in the headers which trailers you will later
	// send by setting the "Trailer" header to the names of the
	// trailer keys which will come later. In this case, those
	// keys of the Header map are treated as if they were
	// trailers. See the example. The second way, for trailer
	// keys not known to the [Handler] until after the first [ResponseWriter.Write],
	// is to prefix the [Header] map keys with the [TrailerPrefix]
	// constant value.
	//
	// To suppress automatic response headers (such as "Date"), set
	// their value to nil.
	Header() Header

	// Write writes the data to the connection as part of an HTTP reply.
	//
	// If [ResponseWriter.WriteHeader] has not yet been called, Write calls
	// WriteHeader(http.StatusOK) before writing the data. If the Header
	// does not contain a Content-Type line, Write adds a Content-Type set
	// to the result of passing the initial 512 bytes of written data to
	// [DetectContentType]. Additionally, if the total size of all written
	// data is under a few KB and there are no Flush calls, the
	// Content-Length header is added automatically.
	//
	// Depending on the HTTP protocol version and the client, calling
	// Write or WriteHeader may prevent future reads on the
	// Request.Body. For HTTP/1.x requests, handlers should read any
	// needed request body data before writing the response. Once the
	// headers have been flushed (due to either an explicit Flusher.Flush
	// call or writing enough data to trigger a flush), the request body
	// may be unavailable. For HTTP/2 requests, the Go HTTP server permits
	// handlers to continue to read the request body while concurrently
	// writing the response. However, such behavior may not be supported
	// by all HTTP/2 clients. Handlers should read before writing if
	// possible to maximize compatibility.
	Write([]byte) (int, error)

	// WriteHeader sends an HTTP response header with the provided
	// status code.
	//
	// If WriteHeader is not called explicitly, the first call to Write
	// will trigger an implicit WriteHeader(http.StatusOK).
	// Thus explicit calls to WriteHeader are mainly used to
	// send error codes or 1xx informational responses.
	//
	// The provided code must be a valid HTTP 1xx-5xx status code.
	// Any number of 1xx headers may be written, followed by at most
	// one 2xx-5xx header. 1xx headers are sent immediately, but 2xx-5xx
	// headers may be buffered. Use the Flusher interface to send
	// buffered data. The header map is cleared when 2xx-5xx headers are
	// sent, but not with 1xx headers.

	// on the first read from the request body if the request has
	// an "Expect: 100-continue" header.

// ServeMux is an HTTP request multiplexer.
// It matches the URL of each incoming request against a list of registered
// patterns and calls the handler for the pattern that
// most closely matches the URL.
//
// # Patterns
//
// Patterns can match the method, host and path of a request.
// Some examples:
//
//   - "/index.html" matches the path "/index.html" for any host and method.
//   - "GET /static/" matches a GET request whose path begins with "/static/".
//   - "example.com/" matches any request to the host "example.com".
//   - "example.com/{$}" matches requests with host "example.com" and path "/".
//   - "/b/{bucket}/o/{objectname...}" matches paths whose first segment is "b"
//     and whose third segment is "o". The name "bucket" denotes the second
//     segment and "objectname" denotes the remainder of the path.
//
// In general, a pattern looks like
//
//	[METHOD ][HOST]/[PATH]
//
// All three parts are optional; "/" is a valid pattern.
// If METHOD is present, it must be followed by at least one space or tab.
//
// Literal (that is, non-wildcard) parts of a pattern match
// the corresponding parts of a request case-sensitively.
//
// A pattern with no method matches every method. A pattern
// with the method GET matches both GET and HEAD requests.
// Otherwise, the method must match exactly.
//
// A pattern with no host matches every host.
// A pattern with a host matches URLs on that host only.
//
// A path can include wildcard segments of the form {NAME} or {NAME...}.
// For example, "/b/{bucket}/o/{objectname...}".
// The wildcard name must be a valid Go identifier.
// Wildcards must be full path segments: they must be preceded by a slash and followed by
// either a slash or the end of the string.
// For example, "/b_{bucket}" is not a valid pattern.
//
// Normally a wildcard matches only a single path segment,
// ending at the next literal slash (not %2F) in the request URL.
// But if the "..." is present, then the wildcard matches the remainder of the URL path, including slashes.
// (Therefore it is invalid for a "..." wildcard to appear anywhere but at the end of a pattern.)
// The match for a wildcard can be obtained by calling [Request.PathValue] with the wildcard's name.
// A trailing slash in a path acts as an anonymous "..." wildcard.
//
// The special wildcard {$} matches only the end of the URL.
// For example, the pattern "/{$}" matches only the path "/",
// whereas the pattern "/" matches every path.
//
// For matching, both pattern paths and incoming request paths are unescaped segment by segment.
// So, for example, the path "/a%2Fb/100%25" is treated as having two segments, "a/b" and "100%".
// The pattern "/a%2fb/" matches it, but the pattern "/a/b/" does not.
//
// # Precedence
//
// If two or more patterns match a request, then the most specific pattern takes precedence.
// A pattern P1 is more specific than P2 if P1 matches a strict subset of P2’s requests;
// that is, if P2 matches all the requests of P1 and more.
// If neither is more specific, then the patterns conflict.
// There is one exception to this rule, for backwards compatibility:
// if two patterns would otherwise conflict and one has a host while the other does not,
// then the pattern with the host takes precedence.
// If a pattern passed to [ServeMux.Handle] or [ServeMux.HandleFunc] conflicts with
// another pattern that is already registered, those functions panic.
//
// As an example of the general rule, "/images/thumbnails/" is more specific than "/images/",
// so both can be registered.
// The former matches paths beginning with "/images/thumbnails/"
// and the latter will match any other path in the "/images/" subtree.
//
// As another example, consider the patterns "GET /" and "/index.html":
// both match a GET request for "/index.html", but the former pattern
// matches all other GET and HEAD requests, while the latter matches any
// request for "/index.html" that uses a different method.
// The patterns conflict.
//
// # Trailing-slash redirection
//
// Consider a [ServeMux] with a handler for a subtree, registered using a trailing slash or "..." wildcard.
// If the ServeMux receives a request for the subtree root without a trailing slash,
// it redirects the request by adding the trailing slash.
// This behavior can be overridden with a separate registration for the path without
// the trailing slash or "..." wildcard. For example, registering "/images/" causes ServeMux
// to redirect a request for "/images" to "/images/", unless "/images" has
// been registered separately.
//
// # Request sanitizing
//
// ServeMux also takes care of sanitizing the URL request path and the Host
// header, stripping the port number and redirecting any request containing . or
// .. segments or repeated slashes to an equivalent, cleaner URL.
//
// # Compatibility
//
// The pattern syntax and matching behavior of ServeMux changed significantly
// in Go 1.22. To restore the old behavior, set the GODEBUG environment variable
// to "httpmuxgo121=1". This setting is read once, at program startup; changes
// during execution will be ignored.
//
// The backwards-incompatible changes include:
//   - Wildcards are just ordinary literal path segments in 1.21.
//     For example, the pattern "/{x}" will match only that path in 1.21,
//     but will match any one-segment path in 1.22.
//   - In 1.21, no pattern was rejected, unless it was empty or conflicted with an existing pattern.
//     In 1.22, syntactically invalid patterns will cause [ServeMux.Handle] and [ServeMux.HandleFunc] to panic.
//     For example, in 1.21, the patterns "/{"  and "/a{x}" match themselves,
//     but in 1.22 they are invalid and will cause a panic when registered.
//   - In 1.22, each segment of a pattern is unescaped; this was not done in 1.21.
//     For example, in 1.22 the pattern "/%61" matches the path "/a" ("%61" being the URL escape sequence for "a"),
//     but in 1.21 it would match only the path "/%2561" (where "%25" is the escape for the percent sign).
//   - When matching patterns to paths, in 1.22 each segment of the path is unescaped; in 1.21, the entire path is unescaped.
//     This change mostly affects how paths with %2F escapes adjacent to slashes are treated.
//     See https://go.dev/issue/21955 for details.
