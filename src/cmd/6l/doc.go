6l is a modified version of the Plan 9 linker.  The original is documented at

	http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/2l

Its target architecture is the x86-64, referred to by these tools as amd64.
It reads files in .6 format generated by 6g, 6c, and 6a and emits
a binary called 6.out by default.

Major changes include:
	- support for ELF and Mach-O binary files
	- support for segmented stacks (this feature is implemented here, not in the compilers).


Original options are listed in the link above.

Options new in this version:

-d
	Elide the dynamic linking header.  With this option, the binary
	is statically linked and does not refer to dynld.  Without this option
	(the default), the binary's contents are identical but it is loaded with dynld.
-e
	Emit an extra ELF-compatible symbol table useful with tools such as
	nm, gdb, and oprofile. This option makes the binary file considerably larger.
-H6
	Write Apple Mach-O binaries (default when $GOOS is darwin)
-H7
	Write Linux ELF binaries (default when $GOOS is linux)
-L dir1,dir2,..
	Search for libraries (package files) in the comma-separated list of directories.
	The default is the single location $GOROOT/pkg/$GOOS_amd64.
-V
	Print the linker version.
