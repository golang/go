Nm is a version of the Plan 9 nm command.  The original is documented at

	http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/nm

It prints the name list (symbol table) for programs compiled by gc as well as the
Plan 9 C compiler.

For reasons of disambiguation it is installed as 6nm although it also serves
as an 8nm and a 5nm.
