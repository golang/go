# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are applied only to the latest release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives us time to work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released.

Please disclose it at [security advisory](https://github.com/ianlancetaylor/demangle/security/advisories/new).

This project is maintained by volunteers on a reasonable-effort basis. As such, please give us at least 90 days to work on a fix before public exposure.
