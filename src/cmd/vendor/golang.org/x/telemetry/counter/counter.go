package counter

// The implementation of this package and tests are located in
// internal/counter, which can be shared with the upload package.
// TODO(hyangah): use of type aliases prevents nice documentation
// rendering in go doc or pkgsite. Fix this either by avoiding
// type aliasing or restructuring the internal/counter package.

// Add adds n to the counter with the given name.

// New returns a counter with the given name.
// New can be called in global initializers and will be compiled down to
// linker-initialized data. That is, calling New to initialize a global
// has no cost at program startup.

	// Note: not calling DefaultFile.New in order to keep this
	// function something the compiler can inline and convert

// A Counter is a single named event counter.
// A Counter is safe for use by multiple goroutines simultaneously.
//
// Counters should typically be created using New
// and stored as global variables, like:
//
//	package mypackage
//	var errorCount = counter.New("mypackage/errors")
//
// (The initialization of errorCount in this example is handled
// entirely by the compiler and linker; this line executes no code
// at program startup.)
//
// Then code can call Add to increment the counter
// each time the corresponding event is observed.
//
// Although it is possible to use New to create
// a Counter each time a particular event needs to be recorded,
// that usage fails to amortize the construction cost over
// multiple calls to Add, so it is more expensive and not recommended.
