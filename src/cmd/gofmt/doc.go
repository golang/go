Gofmt formats Go programs.

Without an explicit path, it processes the standard input.  Given a file,
it operates on that file; given a directory, it operates on all .go files in
that directory, recursively.  (Files starting with a period are ignored.)
By default, gofmt prints the reformatted sources to standard output.

Usage:
	gofmt [flags] [path ...]

The flags are:
	-d
		Do not print reformatted sources to standard output.
		If a file's formatting is different than gofmt's, print diffs
		to standard output.
	-e
		Print all (including spurious) errors.
	-l
		Do not print reformatted sources to standard output.
		If a file's formatting is different from gofmt's, print its name
		to standard output.
	-r rule
		Apply the rewrite rule to the source before reformatting.
	-s
		Try to simplify code (after applying the rewrite rule, if any).
	-w
		Do not print reformatted sources to standard output.
		If a file's formatting is different from gofmt's, overwrite it
		with gofmt's version.

Formatting control flags:
	-comments=true
		Print comments; if false, all comments are elided from the output.
	-tabs=true
		Indent with tabs; if false, spaces are used instead.
	-tabwidth=8
		Tab width in spaces.


The rewrite rule specified with the -r flag must be a string of the form:

	pattern -> replacement

Both pattern and replacement must be valid Go expressions.
In the pattern, single-character lowercase identifiers serve as
wildcards matching arbitrary sub-expressions; those expressions
will be substituted for the same identifiers in the replacement.

When gofmt reads from standard input, it accepts either a full Go program
or a program fragment.  A program fragment must be a syntactically
valid declaration list, statement list, or expression.  When formatting
such a fragment, gofmt preserves leading indentation as well as leading
and trailing spaces, so that individual sections of a Go program can be
formatted by piping them through gofmt.

Examples

To check files for unnecessary parentheses:

	gofmt -r '(a) -> a' -l *.go

To remove the parentheses:

	gofmt -r '(a) -> a' -w *.go

To convert the package tree from explicit slice upper bounds to implicit ones:

	gofmt -r 'α[β:len(α)] -> α[β:]' -w $GOROOT/src/pkg
*/
package main

// BUG(rsc): The implementation of -r is a bit slow.
