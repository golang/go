The scripts in this directory set up version-control repos for use in
tests of cmd/go and its subpackages.

They are written in a dialect of the same script language as in
cmd/go/testdata/script, and the outputs are hosted by the server in
cmd/go/internal/vcweb.

To see the conditions and commands available for these scripts, run:

	go test cmd/go/internal/vcweb -v --run=TestHelp

To host these scripts in a standalone server, run:

	go test cmd/go/internal/vcweb/vcstest -v --port=0
