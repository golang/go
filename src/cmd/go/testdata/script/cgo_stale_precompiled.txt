# Regression test for https://go.dev/issue/47215 and https://go.dev/issue/50183:
# A mismatched $GOROOT_FINAL or missing $CC caused the C dependencies of the net
# package to appear stale, and it could not be rebuilt due to a missing $CC.

# This test may start with the runtime/cgo package already stale.
# Explicitly rebuild it to ensure that it is cached.
# (See https://go.dev/issue/50892.)
#
# If running in non-short mode, explicitly vary CGO_CFLAGS
# as a control case (to ensure that our regexps do catch rebuilds).
