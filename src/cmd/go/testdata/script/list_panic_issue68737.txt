# Issue #68737: Don't panic if the import path string doesn't appear
# in the import error. The string may not appear because it may be
# escaped when quoted as part of the error message.

! go run '' # Quote contains 0x01 byte
! stderr panic
stderr 'malformed import path "\\x01": invalid char ''\\x01'''
