# This test demonstrates the fuzz corpus behavior for packages outside of the main module.
# (See https://golang.org/issue/48495.)

[short] skip

# Set -modcacherw so that the test behaves the same regardless of whether the
# module cache is writable. (For example, on some platforms it can always be
# written if the user is running as root.) At one point, a failing fuzz test
# in a writable module cache would corrupt module checksums in the cache.
env GOFLAGS=-modcacherw


# When the upstream module has no test corpus, running 'go test' should succeed,
# but 'go test -fuzz=.' should error out before running the test.
# (It should NOT corrupt the module cache by writing out new fuzz inputs,
# even if the cache is writable.)
