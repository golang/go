# Before building our test main.go, ensure that an up-to-date copy of
# runtime/cgo is present in the cache. If it isn't, the 'go build' step below
# will fail with "can't open import". See golang.org/issue/29004.
#
# (The fix in golang.org/issue/29004 didn't completely fix the underlying issue:
# cmd/go/internal/load adds a bunch of implicit dependencies
# based on various heuristics, and, due to a bug described in
# https://golang.org/issue/31544#issuecomment-490607180,
# those implicit dependencies are not added early enough during
# loading to properly affect the import graph.)
