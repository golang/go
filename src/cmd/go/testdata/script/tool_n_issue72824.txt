[short] skip 'does a build in using an empty cache'

# Start with a fresh cache because we want to verify the behavior
# when the tool hasn't been cached previously.
env GOCACHE=$WORK${/}cache

# Even when the tool hasn't been previously cached but was built and
# saved to the cache in the invocation of 'go tool -n' we should return
# its cached location.
go tool -n foo
stdout $GOCACHE

# And of course we should also return the cached location on subsequent
# runs.
go tool -n foo
stdout $GOCACHE
