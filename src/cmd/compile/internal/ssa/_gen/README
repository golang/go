This command generates Go code (in the parent directory) for all
the architecture-specific opcodes, blocks, and rewrites. See the
"Hacking on SSA" section in the parent directory's README.md for
more information.

To regenerate everything, run "go generate" on the ssa package
in the parent directory.

The parent directory contains a test in generate_test.go that will fail
if the generated files are not up-to-date, and to allow that test to
run in no-network environments, golang.org/x/tools/go/ast/astutil is
vendored.
