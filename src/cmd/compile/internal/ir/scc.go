// Strongly connected components.
//
// Run analysis on minimal sets of mutually recursive functions
// or single non-recursive functions, bottom up.
//
// Finding these sets is finding strongly connected components
// by reverse topological order in the static call graph.
// The algorithm (known as Tarjan's algorithm) for doing that is taken from
// Sedgewick, Algorithms, Second Edition, p. 482, with two adaptations.
//
// First, a closure function (fn.IsClosure()) cannot be
// the root of a connected component. Refusing to use it as a root forces
// it into the component of the function in which it appears.  This is
// more convenient for escape analysis.
//
// Second, each function becomes two virtual nodes in the graph,
// with numbers n and n+1. We record the function's node number as n
// but search from node n+1. If the search tells us that the component
// number (min) is n+1, we know that this is a trivial component: one function
// plus its closures. If the search tells us that the component number is
// n, then there was a path from node n+1 back to node n, meaning that
// the function set is mutually recursive. The escape analysis can be
// more precise when analyzing a single non-recursive function than
// when analyzing a set of mutually recursive functions.

// VisitFuncsBottomUp invokes analyze on the ODCLFUNC nodes listed in list.
// It calls analyze with successive groups of functions, working from
// the bottom of the call graph upward. Each time analyze is called with
// a list of functions, every function on that list only calls other functions
// on the list or functions that have been passed in previous invocations of
// analyze. Closures appear in the same list as their outer functions.
// The lists are as short as possible while preserving those requirements.
// (In a typical program, many invocations of analyze will be passed just
// a single function.) The boolean argument 'recursive' passed to analyze
// specifies whether the functions on the list are mutually recursive.
// If recursive is false, the list consists of only a single function and its closures.
// If recursive is true, the list may still contain only a single function,
// if that function is itself recursive.
