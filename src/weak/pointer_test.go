	// What we're trying to do is manufacture the conditions under which this
	// bug happens. Specifically, we want:
	//
	// 1. To create a whole bunch of objects that are only weakly-pointed-to,
	// 2. To call Value while the GC is in the mark phase,
	// 3. The new strong pointer to be missed by the GC,
	// 4. The following GC cycle to mark a free object.
	//
	// Unfortunately, (2) and (3) are hard to control, but we can increase
	// the likelihood by having several goroutines do (1) at once while
	// another goroutine constantly keeps us in the GC with runtime.GC.
	// Like throwing darts at a dart board until they land just right.
	// We can increase the likelihood of (4) by adding some delay after
	// creating the strong pointer, but only if it's non-nil. If it's nil,
	// that means it was already collected in which case there's no chance
	// of triggering the bug, so we want to retry as fast as possible.
	// Our heap here is tiny, so the GCs will go by fast.
	//
	// As of 2024-09-03, removing the line that shades pointers during
	// the weak-to-strong conversion causes this test to fail about 50%
	// of the time.
