// A WaitGroup is a counting semaphore typically used to wait
// for a group of goroutines or tasks to finish.
//
// Typically, a main goroutine will start tasks, each in a new
// goroutine, by calling [WaitGroup.Go] and then wait for all tasks to
// complete by calling [WaitGroup.Wait]. For example:
//
//	var wg sync.WaitGroup
//	wg.Go(task1)
//	wg.Go(task2)
//	wg.Wait()
//
// A WaitGroup may also be used for tracking tasks without using Go to
// start new goroutines by using [WaitGroup.Add] and [WaitGroup.Done].
//
// The previous example can be rewritten using explicitly created
// goroutines along with Add and Done:
//
//	var wg sync.WaitGroup
//	wg.Add(1)
//	go func() {
//		defer wg.Done()
//		task1()
//	}()
//	wg.Add(1)
//	go func() {
//		defer wg.Done()
//		task2()
//	}()
//	wg.Wait()
//
// This pattern is common in code that predates [WaitGroup.Go].
//
// A WaitGroup must not be copied after first use.

// If the counter becomes zero, all goroutines blocked on [WaitGroup.Wait] are released.
// If the counter goes negative, Add panics.

//
// Note that calls with a positive delta that occur when the counter is zero
// must happen before a Wait. Calls with a negative delta, or calls with a
// positive delta that start when the counter is greater than zero, may happen
// at any time.
// Typically this means the calls to Add should execute before the statement
// creating the goroutine or other event to be waited for.

// new Add calls must happen after all previous Wait calls have returned.
