// Cond implements a condition variable, a rendezvous point
// for goroutines waiting for or announcing the occurrence
// of an event.
//
// Each Cond has an associated Locker L (often a *Mutex or *RWMutex),
// which must be held when changing the condition and
// when calling the Wait method.
//
// A Cond must not be copied after first use.
//
// In the terminology of the Go memory model, Cond arranges that
// a call to Broadcast or Signal “synchronizes before” any Wait call
// that it unblocks.
//
// For many simple use cases, users will be better off using channels than a
// Cond (Broadcast corresponds to closing a channel, and Signal corresponds to
// sending on a channel).
//
// For more on replacements for sync.Cond, see [Roberto Clapis's series on
// advanced concurrency patterns], as well as [Bryan Mills's talk on concurrency
// patterns].

// typically cannot assume that the condition is true when
