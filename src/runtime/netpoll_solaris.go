// Solaris runtime-integrated network poller.
//
// Solaris uses event ports for scalable network I/O. Event
// ports are level-triggered, unlike epoll and kqueue which
// can be configured in both level-triggered and edge-triggered
// mode. Level triggering means we have to keep track of a few things
// ourselves. After we receive an event for a file descriptor,
// it's our responsibility to ask again to be notified for future
// events for that descriptor. When doing this we must keep track of
// what kind of events the goroutines are currently interested in,
// for example a fd may be open both for reading and writing.
//
// A description of the high level operation of this code
// follows. Networking code will get a file descriptor by some means
// and will register it with the netpolling mechanism by a code path
// that eventually calls runtime·netpollopen. runtime·netpollopen
// calls port_associate with an empty event set. That means that we
// will not receive any events at this point. The association needs
// to be done at this early point because we need to process the I/O
// readiness notification at some point in the future. If I/O becomes
// ready when nobody is listening, when we finally care about it,
// nobody will tell us anymore.
//
// Beside calling runtime·netpollopen, the networking code paths
// will call runtime·netpollarm each time goroutines are interested
// in doing network I/O. Because now we know what kind of I/O we
// are interested in (reading/writing), we can call port_associate
// passing the correct type of event set (POLLIN/POLLOUT). As we made
// sure to have already associated the file descriptor with the port,
// when we now call port_associate, we will unblock the main poller
// loop (in runtime·netpoll) right away if the socket is actually
// ready for I/O.
//
// The main poller loop runs in its own thread waiting for events
// using port_getn. When an event happens, it will tell the scheduler
// about it using runtime·netpollready. Besides doing this, it must
// also re-associate the events that were not part of this current
// notification with the file descriptor. Failing to do this would
// mean each notification will prevent concurrent code using the
// same file descriptor in parallel.
//
// The logic dealing with re-associations is encapsulated in
// runtime·netpollupdate. This function takes care to associate the
// descriptor only with the subset of events that were previously
// part of the association, except the one that just happened. We
// can't re-associate with that right away, because event ports
// are level triggered so it would cause a busy loop. Instead, that
// association is effected only by the runtime·netpollarm code path,
// when Go code actually asks for I/O.
//
// The open and arming mechanisms are serialized using the lock
// inside PollDesc. This is required because the netpoll loop runs
// asynchronously in respect to other Go code and by the time we get
// to call port_associate to update the association in the loop, the
// file descriptor might have been closed and reopened already. The
// lock allows runtime·netpollupdate to be called synchronously from
// the loop thread while preventing other threads operating to the
// same PollDesc, so once we unblock in the main loop, until we loop
// again we know for sure we are always talking about the same file
// descriptor and can safely access the data we want (the event set).
