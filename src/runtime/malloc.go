// Memory allocator.
//
// This was originally based on tcmalloc, but has diverged quite a bit.
// http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html

// The main allocator works in runs of pages.
// Small allocation sizes (up to and including 32 kB) are
// rounded to one of about 70 size classes, each of which
// has its own free set of objects of exactly that size.
// Any free page of memory can be split into a set of objects
// of one size class, which are then managed using a free bitmap.
//
// The allocator's data structures are:
//
//	fixalloc: a free-list allocator for fixed-size off-heap objects,
//		used to manage storage used by the allocator.
//	mheap: the malloc heap, managed at page (8192-byte) granularity.
//	mspan: a run of in-use pages managed by the mheap.
//	mcentral: collects all spans of a given size class.
//	mcache: a per-P cache of mspans with free space.
//	mstats: allocation statistics.
//
// Allocating a small object proceeds up a hierarchy of caches:
//
//	1. Round the size up to one of the small size classes
//	   and look in the corresponding mspan in this P's mcache.
//	   Scan the mspan's free bitmap to find a free slot.
//	   If there is a free slot, allocate it.
//	   This can all be done without acquiring a lock.
//
//	2. If the mspan has no free slots, obtain a new mspan
//	   from the mcentral's list of mspans of the required size
//	   class that have free space.
//	   Obtaining a whole span amortizes the cost of locking
//	   the mcentral.
//
//	3. If the mcentral's mspan list is empty, obtain a run
//	   of pages from the mheap to use for the mspan.
//
//	4. If the mheap is empty or has no page runs large enough,
//	   allocate a new group of pages (at least 1MB) from the
//	   operating system. Allocating a large run of pages
//	   amortizes the cost of talking to the operating system.
//
// Sweeping an mspan and freeing objects on it proceeds up a similar
// hierarchy:
//
//	1. If the mspan is being swept in response to allocation, it
//	   is returned to the mcache to satisfy the allocation.
//
//	2. Otherwise, if the mspan still has allocated objects in it,
//	   it is placed on the mcentral free list for the mspan's size
//	   class.
//
//	3. Otherwise, if all objects in the mspan are free, the mspan's
//	   pages are returned to the mheap and the mspan is now dead.
//
// Allocating and freeing a large object uses the mheap
// directly, bypassing the mcache and mcentral.
//
// If mspan.needzero is false, then free object slots in the mspan are
// already zeroed. Otherwise if needzero is true, objects are zeroed as
// they are allocated. There are various benefits to delaying zeroing
// this way:
//
//	1. Stack frame allocation can avoid zeroing altogether.
//
//	2. It exhibits better temporal locality, since the program is
//	   probably about to write to the memory.
//
//	3. We don't zero pages that never get reused.

// Virtual memory layout
//
// The heap consists of a set of arenas, which are 64MB on 64-bit and
// 4MB on 32-bit (heapArenaBytes). Each arena's start address is also
// aligned to the arena size.
//
// Each arena has an associated heapArena object that stores the
// metadata for that arena: the heap bitmap for all words in the arena
// and the span map for all pages in the arena. heapArena objects are
// themselves allocated off-heap.
//
// Since arenas are aligned, the address space can be viewed as a
// series of arena frames. The arena map (mheap_.arenas) maps from
// arena frame number to *heapArena, or nil for parts of the address
// space not backed by the Go heap. The arena map is structured as a
// two-level array consisting of a "L1" arena map and many "L2" arena
// maps; however, since arenas are large, on many architectures, the
// arena map consists of a single, large L2 map.
//
// The arena map covers the entire possible address space, allowing
// the Go heap to use any part of the address space. The allocator
// attempts to keep arenas contiguous so that large spans (and hence
// large objects) can cross arenas.

	//
	// On most 64-bit platforms, we limit this to 48 bits based on a

	//
	// amd64 hardware limits addresses to 48 bits, sign-extended
	// to 64 bits. Addresses where the top 16 bits are not either
	// all 0 or all 1 are "non-canonical" and invalid. Because of
	// these "negative" addresses, we offset addresses by 1<<47
	// (arenaBaseOffset) on amd64 before computing indexes into
	// the heap arenas index. In 2017, amd64 hardware added
	// support for 57 bit addresses; however, currently only Linux
	// supports this extension and the kernel will never choose an
	// address above 1<<47 unless mmap is called with a hint
	// address above 1<<47 (which we never do).
	//
	// arm64 hardware (as of ARMv8) limits user addresses to 48
	// bits, in the range [0, 1<<48).
	//
	// ppc64, mips64, and s390x support arbitrary 64 bit addresses
	// in hardware. On Linux, Go leans on stricter OS limits. Based
	// on Linux's processor.h, the user address space is limited as
	// follows on 64-bit architectures:
	//
	// Architecture  Name              Maximum Value (exclusive)
	// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
	// amd64         TASK_SIZE_MAX     0x007ffffffff000 (47 bit addresses)
	// arm64         TASK_SIZE_64      0x01000000000000 (48 bit addresses)
	// ppc64{,le}    TASK_SIZE_USER64  0x00400000000000 (46 bit addresses)
	// mips64{,le}   TASK_SIZE64       0x00010000000000 (40 bit addresses)
	// s390x         TASK_SIZE         1<<64 (64 bit addresses)
	//
	// These limits may increase over time, but are currently at
	// most 48 bits except on s390x. On all architectures, Linux
	// starts placing mmap'd regions at addresses that are
	// significantly below 48 bits, so even if it's possible to
	// exceed Go's 48 bit limit, it's extremely unlikely in
	// practice.
	//
	// On 32-bit platforms, we accept the full 32-bit address
	// space because doing so is cheap.
	// mips32 only has access to the low 2GB of virtual memory, so
	// we further limit it to 31 bits.
	//
	// On ios/arm64, although 64-bit pointers are presumably
	// available, pointers are truncated to 33 bits in iOS <14.
	// Furthermore, only the top 4 GiB of the address space are
	// actually available to the application. In iOS >=14, more
	// of the address space is available, and the OS can now
	// provide addresses outside of those 33 bits. Pick 40 bits
	// as a reasonable balance between address space usage by the
	// page allocator, and flexibility for what mmap'd regions
	// we'll accept for the heap. We can't just move to the full
	// 48 bits because this uses too much address space for older
