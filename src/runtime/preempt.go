// Goroutine preemption
//
// A goroutine can be preempted at any safe-point. Currently, there
// are a few categories of safe-points:
//
// 1. A blocked safe-point occurs for the duration that a goroutine is
//    descheduled, blocked on synchronization, or in a system call.
//
// 2. Synchronous safe-points occur when a running goroutine checks
//    for a preemption request.
//
// 3. Asynchronous safe-points occur at any instruction in user code
//    where the goroutine can be safely paused and a conservative
//    stack and register scan can find stack roots. The runtime can
//    stop a goroutine at an async safe-point using a signal.
//
// At both blocked and synchronous safe-points, a goroutine's CPU
// state is minimal and the garbage collector has complete information
// about its entire stack. This makes it possible to deschedule a
// goroutine with minimal space, and to precisely scan a goroutine's
// stack.
//
// Synchronous safe-points are implemented by overloading the stack
// bound check in function prologues. To preempt a goroutine at the
// next synchronous safe-point, the runtime poisons the goroutine's
// stack bound to a value that will cause the next stack bound check
// to fail and enter the stack growth implementation, which will
// detect that it was actually a preemption and redirect to preemption
// handling.
//
// Preemption at asynchronous safe-points is implemented by suspending
// the thread using an OS mechanism (e.g., signals) and inspecting its
// state to determine if the goroutine was at an asynchronous
// safe-point. Since the thread suspension itself is generally
// asynchronous, it also checks if the running goroutine wants to be
// preempted, since this could have changed. If all conditions are
// satisfied, it adjusts the signal context to make it look like the
// signaled thread just called asyncPreempt and resumes the thread.
// asyncPreempt spills all registers and enters the scheduler.
//
// (An alternative would be to preempt in the signal handler itself.
// This would let the OS save and restore the register state and the
// runtime would only need to know how to extract potentially
// pointer-containing registers from the signal context. However, this
// would consume an M for every preempted G, and the scheduler itself
// is not designed to run from a signal handler, as it tends to
// allocate memory and start threads in the preemption path.)

}

// suspendG suspends goroutine gp at a safe-point and returns the
// state of the suspended goroutine. The caller gets read access to
// the goroutine until it calls resumeG.
//
// It is safe for multiple callers to attempt to suspend the same
// goroutine at the same time. The goroutine may execute between
// subsequent successful suspend operations. The current
// implementation grants exclusive access to the goroutine, and hence
// multiple callers will serialize. However, the intent is to grant
// shared read access, so please don't depend on exclusive access.
//
// This must be called from the system stack and the user goroutine on
// the current M (if any) must be in a preemptible state. This
// prevents deadlocks where two goroutines attempt to suspend each
// other and both are in non-preemptible states. There are other ways
// to resolve this deadlock, but this seems simplest.
//
// TODO(austin): What if we instead required this to be called from a
// user goroutine? Then we could deschedule the goroutine while
// waiting instead of blocking the thread. If two goroutines tried to
// suspend each other, one of them would win and the other wouldn't
// complete the suspend until it was resumed. We would have to be
// careful that they couldn't actually queue up suspend for each other
// and then both be suspended. This would also avoid the need for a
// kernel context switch in the synchronous case because we could just
// directly schedule the waiter. The context switch is unavoidable in
// the signal case.
