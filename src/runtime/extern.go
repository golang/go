Package runtime contains operations that interact with Go's runtime system,
such as functions to control goroutines. It also includes the low-level type information
used by the reflect package; see [reflect]'s documentation for the programmable
interface to the run-time type system.

# Environment Variables

The following environment variables ($name or %name%, depending on the host
operating system) control the run-time behavior of Go programs. The meanings
and use may change from release to release.

The GOGC variable sets the initial garbage collection target percentage.
A collection is triggered when the ratio of freshly allocated data to live data
remaining after the previous collection reaches this percentage. The default
is GOGC=100. Setting GOGC=off disables the garbage collector entirely.
[runtime/debug.SetGCPercent] allows changing this percentage at run time.

The GOMEMLIMIT variable sets a soft memory limit for the runtime. This memory limit
includes the Go heap and all other memory managed by the runtime, and excludes
external memory sources such as mappings of the binary itself, memory managed in
other languages, and memory held by the operating system on behalf of the Go
program. GOMEMLIMIT is a numeric value in bytes with an optional unit suffix.
The supported suffixes include B, KiB, MiB, GiB, and TiB. These suffixes
represent quantities of bytes as defined by the IEC 80000-13 standard. That is,
they are based on powers of two: KiB means 2^10 bytes, MiB means 2^20 bytes,
and so on. The default setting is [math.MaxInt64], which effectively disables the
memory limit. [runtime/debug.SetMemoryLimit] allows changing this limit at run
time.

The GODEBUG variable controls debugging variables within the runtime.
It is a comma-separated list of name=val pairs setting these named variables:

	allocfreetrace: setting allocfreetrace=1 causes every allocation to be
	profiled and a stack trace printed on each object's allocation and free.

	clobberfree: setting clobberfree=1 causes the garbage collector to
	clobber the memory content of an object with bad content when it frees
	the object.

	cpu.*: cpu.all=off disables the use of all optional instruction set extensions.
	cpu.extension=off disables use of instructions from the specified instruction set extension.
	extension is the lower case name for the instruction set extension such as sse41 or avx
	as listed in internal/cpu package. As an example cpu.avx=off disables runtime detection
	and thereby use of AVX instructions.

	cgocheck: setting cgocheck=0 disables all checks for packages
	using cgo to incorrectly pass Go pointers to non-Go code.
	Setting cgocheck=1 (the default) enables relatively cheap
	checks that may miss some errors. A more complete, but slow,
	cgocheck mode can be enabled using GOEXPERIMENT (which
	requires a rebuild), see https://pkg.go.dev/internal/goexperiment for details.

	disablethp: setting disablethp=1 on Linux disables transparent huge pages for the heap.
	It has no effect on other platforms. disablethp is meant for compatibility with versions
	of Go before 1.21, which stopped working around a Linux kernel default that can result
	in significant memory overuse. See https://go.dev/issue/64332. This setting will be
	removed in a future release, so operators should tweak their Linux configuration to suit
	their needs before then. See https://go.dev/doc/gc-guide#Linux_transparent_huge_pages.

	dontfreezetheworld: by default, the start of a fatal panic or throw
	"freezes the world", preempting all threads to stop all running
	goroutines, which makes it possible to traceback all goroutines, and
	keeps their state close to the point of panic. Setting
	dontfreezetheworld=1 disables this preemption, allowing goroutines to
	continue executing during panic processing. Note that goroutines that
	naturally enter the scheduler will still stop. This can be useful when
	debugging the runtime scheduler, as freezetheworld perturbs scheduler
	state and thus may hide problems.

	efence: setting efence=1 causes the allocator to run in a mode
	where each object is allocated on a unique page and addresses are
	never recycled.

	gccheckmark: setting gccheckmark=1 enables verification of the
	garbage collector's concurrent mark phase by performing a
	second mark pass while the world is stopped.  If the second
	pass finds a reachable object that was not found by concurrent
	mark, the garbage collector will panic.

	gcpacertrace: setting gcpacertrace=1 causes the garbage collector to
	print information about the internal state of the concurrent pacer.

	gcshrinkstackoff: setting gcshrinkstackoff=1 disables moving goroutines
	onto smaller stacks. In this mode, a goroutine's stack can only grow.

	gcstoptheworld: setting gcstoptheworld=1 disables concurrent garbage collection,
	making every garbage collection a stop-the-world event. Setting gcstoptheworld=2
	also disables concurrent sweeping after the garbage collection finishes.

	gctrace: setting gctrace=1 causes the garbage collector to emit a single line to standard
	error at each collection, summarizing the amount of memory collected and the
	length of the pause. The format of this line is subject to change. Included in
	the explanation below is also the relevant runtime/metrics metric for each field.
	Currently, it is:
		gc # @#s #%: #+#+# ms clock, #+#/#/#+# ms cpu, #->#-># MB, # MB goal, # MB stacks, #MB globals, # P
	where the fields are as follows:
		gc #         the GC number, incremented at each GC
		@#s          time in seconds since program start
		#%           percentage of time spent in GC since program start
		#+...+#      wall-clock/CPU times for the phases of the GC
		#->#-># MB   heap size at GC start, at GC end, and live heap, or /gc/scan/heap:bytes
		# MB goal    goal heap size, or /gc/heap/goal:bytes
		# MB stacks  estimated scannable stack size, or /gc/scan/stack:bytes
		# MB globals scannable global size, or /gc/scan/globals:bytes
		# P          number of processors used, or /sched/gomaxprocs:threads
	The phases are stop-the-world (STW) sweep termination, concurrent
	mark and scan, and STW mark termination. The CPU times
	for mark/scan are broken down in to assist time (GC performed in
	line with allocation), background GC time, and idle GC time.
	If the line ends with "(forced)", this GC was forced by a
	runtime.GC() call.

	harddecommit: setting harddecommit=1 causes memory that is returned to the OS to
	also have protections removed on it. This is the only mode of operation on Windows,
	but is helpful in debugging scavenger-related issues on other platforms. Currently,
	only supported on Linux.

	inittrace: setting inittrace=1 causes the runtime to emit a single line to standard
	error for each package with init work, summarizing the execution time and memory
	allocation. No information is printed for inits executed as part of plugin loading
	and for packages without both user defined and compiler generated init work.
	The format of this line is subject to change. Currently, it is:
		init # @#ms, # ms clock, # bytes, # allocs
	where the fields are as follows:
		init #      the package name
		@# ms       time in milliseconds when the init started since program start
		# clock     wall-clock time for package initialization work
		# bytes     memory allocated on the heap
		# allocs    number of heap allocations

	madvdontneed: setting madvdontneed=0 will use MADV_FREE
	instead of MADV_DONTNEED on Linux when returning memory to the
	kernel. This is more efficient, but means RSS numbers will
	drop only when the OS is under memory pressure. On the BSDs and
	Illumos/Solaris, setting madvdontneed=1 will use MADV_DONTNEED instead
	of MADV_FREE. This is less efficient, but causes RSS numbers to drop
	more quickly.

	memprofilerate: setting memprofilerate=X will update the value of runtime.MemProfileRate.
	When set to 0 memory profiling is disabled.  Refer to the description of
	MemProfileRate for the default value.

	pagetrace: setting pagetrace=/path/to/file will write out a trace of page events
	that can be viewed, analyzed, and visualized using the x/debug/cmd/pagetrace tool.
	Build your program with GOEXPERIMENT=pagetrace to enable this functionality. Do not
	enable this functionality if your program is a setuid binary as it introduces a security
	risk in that scenario. Currently not supported on Windows, plan9 or js/wasm. Setting this
	option for some applications can produce large traces, so use with care.

	panicnil: setting panicnil=1 disables the runtime error when calling panic with nil
	interface value or an untyped nil.

	runtimecontentionstacks: setting runtimecontentionstacks=1 enables inclusion of call stacks
	related to contention on runtime-internal locks in the "mutex" profile, subject to the
	MutexProfileFraction setting. When runtimecontentionstacks=0, contention on
	runtime-internal locks will report as "runtime._LostContendedRuntimeLock". When
	runtimecontentionstacks=1, the call stacks will correspond to the unlock call that released
	the lock. But instead of the value corresponding to the amount of contention that call
	stack caused, it corresponds to the amount of time the caller of unlock had to wait in its
	original call to lock. A future release is expected to align those and remove this setting.

	invalidptr: invalidptr=1 (the default) causes the garbage collector and stack
	copier to crash the program if an invalid pointer value (for example, 1)
	is found in a pointer-typed location. Setting invalidptr=0 disables this check.
	This should only be used as a temporary workaround to diagnose buggy code.
	The real fix is to not store integers in pointer-typed locations.

	sbrk: setting sbrk=1 replaces the memory allocator and garbage collector
	with a trivial allocator that obtains memory from the operating system and
	never reclaims any memory.

	scavtrace: setting scavtrace=1 causes the runtime to emit a single line to standard
	error, roughly once per GC cycle, summarizing the amount of work done by the
	scavenger as well as the total amount of memory returned to the operating system
	and an estimate of physical memory utilization. The format of this line is subject
	to change, but currently it is:
		scav # KiB work (bg), # KiB work (eager), # KiB total, #% util
	where the fields are as follows:
		# KiB work (bg)    the amount of memory returned to the OS in the background since
		                   the last line
		# KiB work (eager) the amount of memory returned to the OS eagerly since the last line
		# KiB now          the amount of address space currently returned to the OS
		#% util            the fraction of all unscavenged heap memory which is in-use
	If the line ends with "(forced)", then scavenging was forced by a
	debug.FreeOSMemory() call.

	scheddetail: setting schedtrace=X and scheddetail=1 causes the scheduler to emit
	detailed multiline info every X milliseconds, describing state of the scheduler,
	processors, threads and goroutines.

	schedtrace: setting schedtrace=X causes the scheduler to emit a single line to standard
	error every X milliseconds, summarizing the scheduler state.

	tracebackancestors: setting tracebackancestors=N extends tracebacks with the stacks at
	which goroutines were created, where N limits the number of ancestor goroutines to
	report. This also extends the information returned by runtime.Stack. Ancestor's goroutine
	IDs will refer to the ID of the goroutine at the time of creation; it's possible for this
	ID to be reused for another goroutine. Setting N to 0 will report no ancestry information.

	tracefpunwindoff: setting tracefpunwindoff=1 forces the execution tracer to
	use the runtime's default stack unwinder instead of frame pointer unwinding.
	This increases tracer overhead, but could be helpful as a workaround or for
	debugging unexpected regressions caused by frame pointer unwinding.

	traceadvanceperiod: the approximate period in nanoseconds between trace generations. Only
	applies if a program is built with GOEXPERIMENT=exectracer2. Used primarily for testing
	and debugging the execution tracer.

	asyncpreemptoff: asyncpreemptoff=1 disables signal-based
	asynchronous goroutine preemption. This makes some loops
	non-preemptible for long periods, which may delay GC and
	goroutine scheduling. This is useful for debugging GC issues
	because it also disables the conservative stack scanning used
	for asynchronously preempted goroutines.

The [net] and [net/http] packages also refer to debugging variables in GODEBUG.
See the documentation for those packages for details.

The GOMAXPROCS variable limits the number of operating system threads that
can execute user-level Go code simultaneously. There is no limit to the number of threads
that can be blocked in system calls on behalf of Go code; those do not count against
the GOMAXPROCS limit. This package's [GOMAXPROCS] function queries and changes
the limit.

The GORACE variable configures the race detector, for programs built using -race.
See the [Race Detector article] for details.

The GOTRACEBACK variable controls the amount of output generated when a Go
program fails due to an unrecovered panic or an unexpected runtime condition.
By default, a failure prints a stack trace for the current goroutine,
eliding functions internal to the run-time system, and then exits with exit code 2.
The failure prints stack traces for all goroutines if there is no current goroutine
or the failure is internal to the run-time.
GOTRACEBACK=none omits the goroutine stack traces entirely.
GOTRACEBACK=single (the default) behaves as described above.
GOTRACEBACK=all adds stack traces for all user-created goroutines.
GOTRACEBACK=system is like “all” but adds stack frames for run-time functions
and shows goroutines created internally by the run-time.
GOTRACEBACK=crash is like “system” but crashes in an operating system-specific
manner instead of exiting. For example, on Unix systems, the crash raises
SIGABRT to trigger a core dump.
GOTRACEBACK=wer is like “crash” but doesn't disable Windows Error Reporting (WER).
For historical reasons, the GOTRACEBACK settings 0, 1, and 2 are synonyms for
none, all, and system, respectively.
The [runtime/debug.SetTraceback] function allows increasing the
amount of output at run time, but it cannot reduce the amount below that
specified by the environment variable.

The GOARCH, GOOS, GOPATH, and GOROOT environment variables complete
the set of Go environment variables. They influence the building of Go programs
(see [cmd/go] and [go/build]).
GOARCH, GOOS, and GOROOT are recorded at compile time and made available by
constants or functions in this package, but they do not influence the execution
of the run-time system.

# Security

On Unix platforms, Go's runtime system behaves slightly differently when a
binary is setuid/setgid or executed with setuid/setgid-like properties, in order
to prevent dangerous behaviors. On Linux this is determined by checking for the
AT_SECURE flag in the auxiliary vector, on the BSDs and Solaris/Illumos it is
determined by checking the issetugid syscall, and on AIX it is determined by
checking if the uid/gid match the effective uid/gid.

When the runtime determines the binary is setuid/setgid-like, it does three main
things:
  - The standard input/output file descriptors (0, 1, 2) are checked to be open.
    If any of them are closed, they are opened pointing at /dev/null.
  - The value of the GOTRACEBACK environment variable is set to 'none'.
  - When a signal is received that terminates the program, or the program
    encounters an unrecoverable panic that would otherwise override the value
    of GOTRACEBACK, the goroutine stack, registers, and other memory related
    information are omitted.
