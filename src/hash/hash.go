// Package hash provides interfaces for hash functions.
package hash

import "io"

// Hash is the common interface implemented by all hash functions.
//
// Hash implementations in the standard library (e.g. [hash/crc32] and
// [crypto/sha256]) implement the [encoding.BinaryMarshaler], [encoding.BinaryAppender]
// and [encoding.BinaryUnmarshaler] interfaces. Marshaling a hash implementation
// allows its internal state to be saved and used for additional processing
// later, without having to re-write the data previously written to the hash.
// The hash state may contain portions of the input in its original form,
// which users are expected to handle for any possible security implications.
//
// Compatibility: Any future changes to hash or crypto packages will endeavor
// to maintain compatibility with state encoded using previous versions.
// That is, any released versions of the packages should be able to
// decode data written with any previously released version,
// subject to issues such as security fixes.
// See the Go compatibility document for background: https://golang.org/doc/go1compat
type Hash interface {
	// Write (via the embedded io.Writer interface) adds more data to the running hash.
	// It never returns an error.

	// Sum appends the current hash to b and returns the resulting slice.
	// It does not change the underlying hash state.
	Sum(b []byte) []byte

	// Reset resets the Hash to its initial state.
	Reset()

	// Size returns the number of bytes Sum will return.
	Size() int

	// BlockSize returns the hash's underlying block size.
	// The Write method must be able to accept any amount
	// of data, but it may operate more efficiently if all writes
	// are a multiple of the block size.
