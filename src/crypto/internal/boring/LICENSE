The Go source code and supporting files in this directory
are covered by the usual Go license (see ../../../../LICENSE).

When building with GOEXPERIMENT=boringcrypto, the following applies.

The goboringcrypto_linux_amd64.syso object file is built
from BoringSSL source code by build/build.sh and is covered
by the BoringSSL license reproduced below and also at
https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/+/fips-20190808/LICENSE.

BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL. As such, large parts of it fall under OpenSSL
licensing. Files that are completely new have a Google copyright and an ISC
license. This license is reproduced at the bottom of this file.

Contributors to BoringSSL are required to follow the CLA rules for Chromium:
https://cla.developers.google.com/clas

Some files from Intel are under yet another license, which is also included
underneath.

The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of the
OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit. See below
for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open Source
licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL please contact
openssl-core@openssl.org.

The following are Google-internal bug numbers where explicit permission from
some authors is recorded for use of their work. (This is purely for our own
record keeping.)
